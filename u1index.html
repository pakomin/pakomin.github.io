    the area beneath metro stations in delhi can be unpleasant. blocking the sun and the sky above you, is the grey concrete of the station's underside. below you is the black asphalt of the road. and reverberating in this unholy conclave of cement and stone, are the noises of car engines and horns. there's usually no trees. sidewalks accumulate litter, sometimes cows. i (and most people i see) navigate this area quickly - there's not much point spending time here and there are other nicer places to be, to which the metro will take you. so it's ok i guess.
<p>
  one of those nicer places i was heading to recently was the gym. it's right next to the metro station in my area. between the two is an alley in a dug up state. while walking through it today i saw a small mouse on the ground, laying on its side and hyperventilating, with the noonday sun beating down on its heaving body. i stood there for a minute, collecting my thoughts. 

  having seen someone else weep tt


  i didn't think to check my cellphone and ask AI what i ought to ideally do. i did have cold water on me. so i poured some on the mouse, thinking that it might help him cool down. i waited for it to spring back to life and scamper away. but it squealed a little and continued hyperventilating on its side. i left.

  after i was done with my workout, i passed it by again. this time it was still. eyes closed. dead.

      <p>you'll find me in the bed that i made years ago, struggling to find words for what i've felt and done. grapes of wrath, flowers of evil, an unforgiving chimera tearing everything to pieces. </p>
      <p>i'm sorry. for all the havoc and pain.</p>
      <p>i was sick. am sick. but convalescing now, amid the detritus of a life that once had more order, meaning and love...and now with the lingering memories of someone who is now somewhere else - in a boat, rowing conscientously, towards a better place hopefully.</p>

      <p>here's a song that reminds me of them, and their capacity to feel and express love.</p>

   the song is "la vie en rose", first sung by Edith Piaf in 1935.

      <p>other times, I find myself walking in little parks late at night, singing the following song to myself...

	a melody to commemorate sorrow, felt on observing all the wounds inflicted by a creature lashing out in pain:</p>
