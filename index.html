<a href="https://pulkit12083.github.io">this used to be me</a>

Then I discovered psychosis..

Now I'm fragmented, a pincer made of pain and hope, hacking at life and occasionally people.

Some things I do these days:
- code like an amateur
- walk in arcane patterns
- ruminate of poorer days
- daydream of better days
- lift (not so much)
- talk (to those who listen)
