      <p> You'll find my fingerprints in every book. every page from every
corner of time bears the mark of my hand having held it, the oil from
my fingertips seeping into the ink of each letter. such is my presence
in the realm of text. from Hesiod to Rumi - none was spared the
scrutiny of my eye, the audience of my ear, the rapaciousness of my
appetite for text. So staunch was the vigor of my conviction that
somewhere, someone has the right words for this agonizing ache inside
me, about as old as memory itself.</p>
        
        <p>And so, I tottered through cybernetic jungles, hacking through
thickets of wire, killing bugs, and gazing into every screen till my
drool made puddles between my feet, hypnotized and in eager want to
feel anything other than this void in my stomach. When tired, I slept
in concrete caves emblazoned with marble and glass, dreaming of a life
in communal kitchens and a full belly, waking up only reluctantly to
the realer and acute presence of hunger, insidiously growing and
breeding in me the malaise of disquiet, urging me to keep looking.</p>

	<p>With this compromised will, I'd pull myself together and
resume foraging for newer pages, prying sentences off from each and
placing them on my tongue. Sometimes I had to chew; metaphor and
propaganda resisting my bite the hardest. And sometimes they posed no
resistence; particularly tales of clinical depression and loss. Each
sentence invariably dissolved between my teeth and became mush,
suffusing this maw and the back of my head with the essence of its
taste before being swallowed whole. I consumed indiscrimiately at
first, driven by my capacity to digest whatever came my way. A sign,
surely, of a sturdy gut which would not fail me when the words I have
been looking for came my way. They would turn in my belly, breaking
down into axioms and truths, changing the color of my blood from green
to red, dispelling confusion doubt from my lungs, from my speech, and
I would finally be whole. I would return to civilization and be a
human among other humans - understood and accepted. Until then, I'd
keep looking, with an empty stomach gnawing at my insides, churning
the choicest literature into the singular statement: "not good
enough".</p>

	<p>Eventually I discovered a greenhouse, home to a spirit tending rhubarb
and thyme. Face as round and pale as the moon, I saw it lumbering
between planted bok choi and jasmine. I saw it looking at me from
inside, clutching a page dense with scribbles in red. I asked to be
let in and was allowed with a gesture of loving grace. I looked
towards the pages on its person and it, seeing me looking at them,
held them out to me . I went nearer and accepted. And then I took a
bite, expecting it to nourish like nothing else. Words from a spirit
after all. How could I possibly want anything more. Dismay set in
rather quickly when it tasted like sugar; simple, cloying, treacly,
and only aggravating an urge that i wanted to be done with. I quietly
placed the remaining letters in my pocket, and stared at the being
which had made them, looked into its eyes, both wet and reflecting the
image of someone obviously in distress. I averted my gaze. The pangs
of hunger had returned, necessitating the continuation of the
search. Not unlike a feral animal, I set myself about in this
greenhouse looking for reprieve, looking for whatever it is that i had
been denied all my life. I aggressively pulled at the stems of planted
lemongrass and chamomile, uprooting them from the soil and chewing
onto them expecting flavor and fulllness. The spirit took my left hand
and held it briefly, allowing me to sense the stillness in its palm
against the agitation of mine. Neither of us had spoken a word that
the other could understand but almost everything had been said. it led
me to the center of its home - inexplicably a kitchen. it walked up to
the flame and cooking on the pan above it was wheat. the spirit handed
me a spoon and with the impudence of child, i helped myself to the
food at hand, realizing for the first time, what it means to eat.</p>
