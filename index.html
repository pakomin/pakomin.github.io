<br>"I'm in love with you,
<br>I'm in love with you,
<br>I'm in love with you, and you.."
</p>

<p>
Billy Corgan's voice sings Luna from Siamese dream in my head. I get
out of bed and go nowhere. Sitting, and then standing with the song in
my head, I am okay here. Before the show comes to an end, in my head
and out in the world, I hope to be free of the things i want to say,
say and be done with, say and then rest. Of them, one wants to express
gratitude to Ana and Rene - tell them that i will always think of my
time with fondness and love, that despite what they now know me to be,
I hope for them to see my misguided ways and insidious actions in less
shocking light..
</p>

<p>
Then comes to mind the other thing- the thing that i read in my diary
yesterday night - detailing what i thought and wanted back when i was
under the influence. When everything was driven by it. Rather, when i
allowed everything to be driven by it. That seemed to be the human
thing to do - to fall back in place, fall back into myself, into the
thing that has seemingly always been there. the unspoken ever present
want.
</p>

<p>
<br>"I'm in love with you,
<br>I'm in love with you (so in love),
<br>I'm in love with you, again"
</p>

<p>
..croons Billy Corgan. I can feel the melody bringing me closer to
communion with him in what he's trying to express but i find the
attempt falling short, with the word "love" evoking now something
poisoned in my head. Whatever unbesmirched innocent thing it meant for
me before I met Ana, is now poisoned by what I have used it to mean
and do with her. So these days I am unable to give myself to it, to
love, not knowing what it used to be before I adulterated its meaning
under influence. Maybe if I listen to Billy Corgan sing about love
over and over again, it will bring me closer to a purer understanding
of the word. His voice I trust more than even Ana's for some
reason. It seems marred and chiseled with the kind of pain that i seem
to understand. Ana's voice - softer and sweeter - sings "hold me close
and hold me fast, this magic spell you cast, This is la vie en roses",
strumming the guitar and recording herself personally and specifically
for me. She's apologizing for having slept through a meeting with me
at the park, the park where we saw a bench under tree and felt it
emblematic of our bench partnership. When I first saw the video I
remember feeling disdain and confusion. Why would anyone apologize by
singing someone else's song about life always being roses, when
everything in my life, particularly that day with her absence, was
anything but like that. I never trusted this pure unbesmirched form of
love, the kind she carried and expressed. It seemed ignorant of the
devious bastardly nature that every man carries in him, ignorant of
how fucking hard and awful and difficult life can get between two
people when they reach the limits of their compassion and
understanding to each other. She barely knew me, barely knew of my
hatred for her having given herself to her ex in a way she never did
to me, barely knew of what i had hoped from her and how much denial
and pain and agonized deprivation in which i lived, in wait for her to
arrive where i am with respect to life. Now 2 years later, finding her
love shattered by pages from my diary - i think she's probably
somewhere closer than before. She's where I had worried she would be
after meeting me - where I told her apprehensively she might find
herself after she's done with me. She's somewhere else. She's where I
told her she would arrive - telling those dear to her about the toxic
ex in me. She never believed in this prediction, but it came true
nonetheless. Except now she isn't singing la vie en rose to me any
more. Billy Corgan, separated by time and distance, unaware of my
existence, is still singing Luna to me, since before Ana and now after
her too.
</p>

<p>
I have to tell you however, that there was truth in Ana's voice. When
she sang la vie en rose, and maybe even till today - i have never
doubted its sincerity. What i used to doubt was its maturity. Its
capacity to account for the influence under which i live, in which I
have always lived. The unspoken and ineffable drive under the
influence of which so many fall from grace. I accused her once of
manipulating me, when all she was doing was trying to tell me how much
she cared. Not wanting to get entrapped in the childlike love of a
person unaware of their impact on me, unaware of where my heart truly
lay. So, unable to respect either them (for not being able to see the
truth), nor myself (for not being able to say it), nor myself for
being unable to nip it in the bud, I fell into what i felt most
immediate, fell into the influence.
</p>

<p>
It's over now, I tell myself. Over for the most part, at least. I'm
anticipating a couple more texts exchanged in a few months from now
before the severance is complete. Then it will be over - at least in
terms of contact. How these things stay and affect her and me as life
goes on is hard to say. In that regard, nothing ever truly fully
ends. "Time is a circle" - I remember someone saying to me. Not sure
what they meant, I tried to make sense of it in my head. Now, here in
the present, I am inclined to think about how older meanings and
events recur in one's mind, ever developing and deepening in meaning,
as newer perspective illuminates and darkens the varied aspects of
experience. Nothing stays the same. Not friendships, not careers, not
relationships, and definitely not the love that someone tells you is
permanent and certain to last a lifetime, last past the damning
confessions of a psyche under influence.  
</p>

<p>
<br>"i'm in love again,
<br>i'm in love again ohh I'm in love
<br>i'm in love again, with you"
</p>

<p>
.. sings a voice like billy corgan's with lyrics changed from the
original song. i'm unsure why i remember it this way in my
head. especially considering i'm unlikely to be in love again. even if
i find myself drawn to someone again - i won't ever know if it is love
or the influence acting up again, especially not know that i've
deliberately used the word to conflate them both. maybe that is
karma. the result of profaning the most pure and innocent thing in the
world.
</p>

<p>
a memory of that pure and innocent thing comes to me - her singing on
her guitar and recording herself - with a summer boil on her cheek,
long curly hair flowing down to a t-shirt draping the venus of
weillendorf. Unsure how to react, i ask myself what to do with
this. Dissociating from the senses, I reason with my inner disquiet
and tell myself that it is the thought that counts, not realizing that
I'm lying to myself.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday night, I read what i wrote about her under influence and
felt sick. I went for a walk, dazed and tired of the never-ending
rigmarole of uncovering more and more dirt with each passing month,
throwing up each time. nauseated and sick, i walk towards where i
expect to find Nike and Tails. They're and approach me excitedly to
pet. It's 3AM. I sit down and with whatever energy i have left in me,
I pet their heads and ask them when it will end. When if not now can
one expect one's prayer for reprieve and rest to be answered. I give
up. I stand and go to a corner and throw up. With a swimming head and
a queasy stomach, I vomit out what I hope is the last amount of poison
in my gut. Maybe once it is all out, I can feel pure, innocent, and
unshattered again. Unable to tell what's more polluted, the air i'm
breathing choking my sinuses, or the insides of my gut that i now see
spilling outward by the agonized contractions of my gastric tract. I
look inward and towards some higher power, and implore it my enervated
constitution in a state of sheer exhaustion, implore it to end it all,
to rid me of this continual return to discovering more poison in me
and serving it out to the world one episode of retching and throwing
up at a time.
</p>

<p>
Today I find myself looking at last night's puke and trying to discern
whether the red in it is part of my gut or something i consumed a long
time ago. I had hoped to write more about her, about the good i
remember in her, despite how pathetic i imagine it might seem to
anyone observing it all. Instead, there's this puke staring back at
me, asking me if i see anything human in it, in myself, all over
again.

</div>


<p>
The guitar from "Oh Sweet Nuthin!" by velvet underground plays in my
head, kickstarting the song with Lou Reed's voice singing "say a word
for Jimmy Brown..".
</p>

<p>
It calls to my mind what i head about Chandan. he was last seen
tearing grass out of a park by the fistful. before that he was seen
writing in his diary in his room, barely illuminated. at one point his
elderly mother came into the room and asked him if he's doing
alright. convinced that he is, that he's close to understanding what
to do about how he feels about losing someone dear to him, he says he
just needs some more time to write about how it all got to this point.
</p>

<p>
"till when will you stay in this room dear?" his mom would ask having
lost track of how many months it had been since he confined himself
into it with his pen and notebook. she tried turning on the light but
he got up to turn it off, telling her that it helps him to be in
dimmer light that's not as harsh on his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"please just give me some time. i know what i'm doing. i'm meditating
and writing and thinking and just taking some time to process
things" - he explains away his seclusion, not knowing how else to
speak of whom he lost, not knowing where to begin explaining how it
got to that point. he just needed to find a way to make himself
understand and then everything would be ok. he's writing in his diary
about fear, about how he's made up of the things he sees in his father
and mother, identifying different strands of traits and thoughts and
tracing their lineage in him going back in time to his parents, to
ascertain what in him did he need to change to accept what had
happened. what part of him was responsible in bringing things to such
an end. he set about, thinking and talking to himself about it,
reflecting and ruminating on the way to work, at work, on the way
back, on his interminable walks around the neighborhood. eventually he
felt the need for a notebook and in it he began to detail his deepest
flaws and issues - things which if they were different, could've
prevented what perpetually aggrieved him now. The people in his life
tried to talk to him about what had happened but he couldn't bring
himself to do it. "I just need some time..". He told them about having
had a difficult break with someone he was close to, not going as far
as to reveal anything beyond it. 
</p>

<p>
eventually it seemed to him that he'd identified everything in
him. everything he could recognize in himself, he wrote down in his
notebook. good, bad, and everyhing in between. he had emptied himself
out. nothing was left inside him anymore except a raw consciousness
without any essence whatsoever. all he needed to do now was to give it
a new shape. start afresh in building himself up again block by block,
choosing each of these blocks with patience and love and non-violence.
</p>


<p>
He'd find himself driving to the buddha jayanti park, carrying his
diary, his pen, his wallet, the book called "non-violent
communication", and a bag that he once bought from the hills. It's
unclear what happened there. A policeman reported him walking through
the trails in there until late in the evening. The hut in that park
where they served food revealed that he was seen sitting and
ruminating and writing about something. The waiter asked him if he
wanted anything to eat and he declined, saying that he will order
eventually, before getting up to leave, walking to a nearby lawn,
reading every plaque containing Buddha's sayings along the way. As if
to find direction, any direction whatsoever out and away from what had
transpired.
</p>

<p>
It was then that everyone he was close to in his life began to receive
his messages. Grief gave way to pain, and commensurate to this pain
was the viciousness of his accusations towards everyone - each for
being culpable in bringing him here, to this point. Until he emptied
himself of the poisonous anger he felt, there could be no moving
forward. For some he had no forgiveness. His father for having
fostered dependence. His mother for having fostered fear. after him,
it was them who were most at fault, he felt, or reasoned. not sure
anymore what the difference was between the two. it all needed to
change. it all needed to end. life couldn't go on like this. life
wouldn't go on after this. if there was any meaning woven between him
and those around him, it had to account for what had happened. and so,
reverberating back from the end of is life, like a ripple in the pond
meeting the edge and turning back, he turned towards everyone in his
past for a final reckoning with the issues pervading their
lives. after having had his say, after made everyone cognizant of the
enormity of their influences on him, he threw his phone on the grass
and planned to go somewhere far away from it all. 
</p>



<hr>
    <p> deposited on the shore with no time to dry myself, i am
      discovered by well-meaning fishermen. i give them whatever
      remains in my pocket before i get loaded on the back of an open
      ceiling truck headed away from the sea. drenched, in wet hair
      and clothes, i'm on my back looking up at a cloudy dark blue
      sky, struggling to breathe in the thin air outside the
      ocean. it's raining. pools of water accumulate on the floor of
      the truck around me. raindrops fall on my face and cloud my view
      of the sky. everything is blue and i cannot tell if it is dawn
      or dusk. the rattle of the truck hurts my head, so i turn to my
      side and rest it on my folded hands. I'm weary and tired. i
      think i could sleep for a thousand years.

	<p>Dreamgirl by Teenage Blue plays in my head. Lacey Hopkins's
	voice expresses how i feel better than anything i could write
	ever could. I wish I had her ability. I don't. What I do have
	with me, are fragmented reflections of the past. As of now,
	they seem to have changed nothing for the better. Brought no
	catharsis, or any hopes for reconciliation. 7 years of
	closeness, of warmth, are now receding from the present with
	each passing day, replaced by a new emptiness. Fuck this. What
	is left to save anymore, I do not know. What is left to try to
	do, I do not know. All I can sense from where I am now is the
	futility in trying to control the course of things. So, I
	resign myself to the inner laws of spirit and the outer laws
	of nature to meet how they might, and dictate the
	same. Nothing seems to merit the destruction wrought by
	resisting either.
	  <div hidden>
	  <p>Sometimes I wonder if I'll run into Ana or Reni ever
	  again. It seems unlikely given the sprawl across which I see
	  everyone scatter these days. But I still find myself
	  wondering how a chance encounter might go. I wonder what I
	  would say in response to what I know they think of me
	  now. If there's something pithy and true that would diffuse
	  the contempt and the disdain I imagine they now harbor for
	  me. If there's anything that could now clarify my position
	  as one among them as a human, as opposed to one among the
	  general class of parasitic and abusive fiends that are the
	  men they've known in life. Nothing comes to mind. It might
	  make more sense to just accept whatever look I get -
	  indicating my position as now a painful but ultimately
	    irrelevant artifact of the past.

	    <p>For them, there's no time left to even consider
	  building bridges. I imagine they're thinking ahead, towards
	  starting families, having children, immigrating abroad,
	  escaping the ghastly and grinding realities of life in this
	  country. Newer places to which to row. To not be a nuisance,
	  a pest, an unwanted imposition - I imagine keeping to myself
	  and looking at them as they move away - both in the imagined
	  chance encounter in public, or in life. In the present, I
	  acknowledge that my tendency to imagine this scenario comes
	  from the latent urge to change things for the better and
	  control the currently inevitable outcome of adriftness and
	  distance. To change things away from where they are right
	      now - where i exist as a pariah to be avoided or blocked.

    <p>who if not you will ever care again about my watermelony head.

    <div hidden>
    <hr>
      <p>dog 1.

    <p>i don't know when i started getting into altercations with
    people in my neighborhood over stray dogs. the first time was in
    2023 when i went running outdoors under the illusion that the cure
    to the insidious weirdness in my head was cardio. It was a summer
    evening, and people were outdoors with their pet dogs on
    leashes. As I attempted to run past a german shepherd without
    breaking my stride, it lunged at me and growled viciously. Rattled
    by the sudden attack, I yelled back at it - "bhenchod what the
    fuck", and then turning towards the owner to yell him just the
    same. He retorted by chastising me for not knowing any better than
    to run past a dog who was naturally going to act the way it did,
    as if it was common knowledge. Not wanting to get further
    involved, I continued running my lap around the area, thoroughly
    unnerved. I had lost whatever moral ground i had as the victim to
    his beast, by berating them both and escalating the situation into
    a tawdry street conflict. The concept of karma, instilled in my
    head months ago by a member of a cult, played in my head over and
    over. I had furthered the cycle of violence. I had sowed bad
    karma. I must make amends. And so when I completed my lap and
    circled back to the duo once again, I stood calmly and
    apologized. Told him that i could have handled that with more
    kindness. This seemed to embolden him further. "Tujhme dimaag nahi
    hai? Kutta toh janwar hai par tum to insaan ho. koi bhi tkutte ke
    aage bhaagta hai kya!". Feral and unnerved still from being
    lunched at by his dog which was now still barking at me, held in
    place by the surd's leash, I looked at him and said "But I am
    apologizing now. Please let this go.". He continues with "Toh mai
    kya karu agar tumne sorry kaha hai toh". Finding it futile to
    engage with his righteous indignation spurred by my apology, I
    left and came back home to rest on the sofa and mentally "process"
    the encounter. By "process", I mean: do what back then was my
    understanding of how one copes with an unhinged feral nervous
    system - shaking and psychologically looping through the incident
    in my head over and over in my head, laying on the sofa in front
    of an AC on full blast cooling me down person that i was.


      <p>My parents would come home and ask me why i was shaken. I
      recounted the incident to them and they listened patiently and
      compassionately - reassuring me at the end that it was silly for
      us to expect the other inconsiderate people of the neighborhood
      to understand. Whatever they said after that, and what i did for
      the rest of the evening on that sofa beyond tremble and mentally
      process the incident has faded from my memory. The next
      afternoon I'm sitting at a table in the house, "processing"
      whatever absurd stream of ideas have possessed me on that day,
      when my gaze falls on the kitchen window looking out at some
      eucalyptus trees and then the gaze stops right there and
      then. I'm not sure why but there's something about that sight,
      of the trees through the mesh net of the kitchen window that has
      now arrested my attention. Then, comes the image of the german
      shepherd's face tearing through the view and barking directly at
      me in the middle of the house. Reeling, i try to mentally stitch
      back together the fabric of my attention back to its usual state
      before it is torn and invaded by another anomalous
      terror. Unclear when the next infraction is due, I set about
      processing what has just happened with whatever mental mental
      contortions i was convinced could save me on that day.

	<p hidden>what occurs to me now two and half years later, is
	how he expected me to cohere and adapt to the world he
	created. the dog barks at running people, so ofcourse, you
	must not run near it. the dog shits on the road, so ofcourse,
	you must run around it. the dog lunging and growling at me was
	axiomatic. it was nature. my verbal agony, the rage, the
	denial to run to save my life (as i believed), were all either
	secondary or irrelevant or invisible to this surd. that my
	visceral terror was simply not part of his idea of what a
	human could be. as time would go on, i would find myself
	confined in my room looking out the window at his dog growling
	and barking and lunging at other dogs on his evening walks -
	wondering if he ever felt responsible for any of it.


      <p>- 25/10/25 04:27
      </div>
    <hr>
    <p> as i float on my back, with my head looking up at the blank
    sky, i sense the tide beneath me receding, slowly at first, then
    very quickly. i worry that dry land is nearer than i initially
    thought. with no inclination to swim towards it, i let the
    currents decide to do what they may. if i am to find myself washed
    up, i might stay there, looking at the ocean till i'm compelled to
    otherwise. i'm not ready to say goodbye to it yet. i do not want
    to be away from it. memory of being engulfed in it and swirling to
    its currents would keep me closer to her in some way - knowing
    that sooner or later i'd find myself washed up anyway into an unkown
    place.

      <p>what can i possibly do to remain here, with all the memories
      of her close to my chest taking me back towards her in some
      circuitous way. i know that at this point i can't do
      anything. any rational or sensible person would know by this
      point that it is over. that she is gone. that there is no
      conceivable going back from here. but that realization hasn't
      dawned on me yet. it comes to my mind every now and then, in
      little ways, as i experience the passage of time without her,
      and reread older messages in which she conveys that she has her
      own independent journey now. i think about the last time we
      talked after a long interval of silence, from which she emerged
      more detached and dispassionate - likely aided by the colder and
      clinical gaze of a psychotherapist and the shocked indignation
      of those close to her at the knowledge of what i'm capable of
      thinking. i wonder how this current interval of silence will
      end, if it will end at all - and I realize I do not have any
      trust in it ending any better, especially considering the
      incident that led to it.

      <p>it was in this june that i inadvertently inflicted the final
      and decisive wound. it was too much. i tried to help immediately
      after, in explaining myself, in helping with the wound, but even
      that i did too aggressively without knowing it. the aggressive
      insistence in my defence reminds me now of early 2021, when it
      was the other way round - when the wound was on me and it was
      her who was fighting for her place in my world. i thought to
      stay with her then. i would ask her to let me stay with her now
      but i already know that the answer is going to be "no". so,
      swept up by the invisible waves of remorse and want for her in
      my life, i drift in unknown directions all across the ocean,
      knowing that surely i will eventually i will be deposited on
      some unknown piece of land isolated and impossibly far away from
      where she is. maybe we will find ourselves in different
      continents. i wonder then, if i stand up on the patch of land
      where i am, and yell loud enough, earnestly enough, truthfully
      enough about how i truly felt when i was with her, then will it
      somehow reach her all the way where she is. the bridges that
      would need to be built would take decades and it might be
      utterly delusional to think that one could build any across such
      vast distances but i find myself wanting to try, for whatever
      that is worth - which is almost everything.
      

      <p>what with my manner of writing here and speaking to people -
      without much of a working mind behind it - my words might read
      like an artless array of fragmented thoughts from someone
      linguistically challenged . i am not oblivious to the errors i
      am making in text, the awkwardness of my analogies, the lack of
      flow and cohesion and how often i am failing at conveying what
      is central to my intent, and all the other issues in my
      writing. i wish i could write more about all the painfully sweet
      things that come to my mind when i think about her, or all the
      things about her that come to my mind when i think about life
      and when life occurs to me. how it feels to go through life
      without a bench partner, without her soft and gentle reassurance
      by my side and the security of knowing that it will
      stay. isolating and meaningless beyond measure. i wish i could
      write about the better aspects of her that stay with me still,
      and how much i see of herself in me when i talk to people
      now. why can i not write about that? Why was it so easy to write
      the treatise of hate that i sent to you?  why can i not write
      equally well of love?  do i just not experience love as directly
      and simple and closely as i experience hate? was the pain i felt
      in late 2020 so sharp and intense? if it produced the most
      devastating instrument of murder by words i have ever read then
      it must be. the pain really must be intense. i'm accused of
      hiding it, concealing it, so that i could get what i want from
      her before the eventual dismemberment - accused of being
      duplicitous, dishonest, and manipulative. what if my concealment
      was not with the intention of using her illicitly but with the
      intention of not causing harm? with the simple naivety of a
      child who knows not to hurt others and does not know how to do
      it? despite everything that happened in that year, the pain i
      endured both physical and mental, i eventually saw the truth in
      her, the sadness in her, the meaning she attached to me in her
      life, and i stayed with her - guarded and emotionally avoidant
      but still staying. for her and also partly for me.


      <p>"You should have called it quits a long time ago but even that
      you didn't, because you were being selfish."

      <p>I was a selfish boy. i am guilty here. but i am also only
      human. i am fallible and make mistakes. i am sorry i didn't. but
      i needed you and i think you needed me too. so, keeping feelings
      aside, i stayed out of need. if you have read my most
      uncharitable ways of looking at us from that time, then i hope
      you will read about the most charitable ways too. it is not
      wrong to have a need. it is wrong to hide it, or to betray
      someone for it. but i tried to speak of it without it affecting
      you. i think i tried. if you go back to our older messages,
      you'll see that i tried..


      <p>pause.. breathe.. 

      <p>"Most of all, i want you to tell yourself that it's in the past
      and it's time to move on"


      <p>i know that explanations won't change what has happened, the
      hurt that has already been felt. even if i were to exonerate
      myself fully, the fact of the hurt inflicted by my pain, anger,
      hate remains unchangeable in our past. that by itself warrants
      an end, as you've come to sense. i'm not unaware of what has
      happened and how it warrants a different future. maybe you're
      asking me to tell myself that it's time to move on because you
      already have. after all, you have found yourself occupied in
      rewarding work, making dreams of other children come true,
      through literature and writing. what you do is at the sweet
      intersection of everything you ever wanted to do in life. how
      could the sordid past with me possibly call for your interest
      anymore. it is possible that you're already thinking of the
      future - and eventually that will involve someone else. but
      before that happens and becomes concrete, i would like still to
      try to tell you what you were to me. not just a body, but a
      person inextricable from the marrow of my life over the past few
      years. if you were to ask me how i intend to make anything work,
      i have no answer. i just want to tell you what you mean to me,
      what you meant to me, and what i am hoping for you to mean to me
      going ahead. i might sound pathetic, but i don't particularly
      mind that because i don't see pathos in a way that is
      antithetical to self-respect and dignity. i lacked the latter
      two as i mentally disintegrated and confessed the worst aspects
      of my psyche to you - but only because i could not imagine in
      either of us, a person who would see the human in me despite
      what i revealed. i have strived to understand people and see the
      human in them through my life and i hope that with time you will
      see the human beneath what seems like a monster in my
      representation of myself to you too. then maybe there is hope
      for something good once again.

	<p>until then, swept up by where i am taken by the currents of
	  life, i will hope to look towards the ocean that is your
	  presence and absence in my life still. not with hate, not
	  anymore, but with compassion and appreciation once again..

    <hr>
    <p>i would not like for death and disease to catch me by surprise
    again. when it strikes next, i would like to be prepared. to have
    bared my heart in full to everyone i know. leave nothing
    unsaid. especially not to everyone i love and care for. i don't
    want it to be too late for that. till recently i used to think of
    my life as a long-term project. one which i have to systematically
    build in as ideal a way as possible. make good decisions, strive
    for the best opportunities, and take seriously the effort required
    in doing the right thing. having heard so often about the
    unfortunate conditions people found themselves in this country due
    to decisions that cost them heavily, i carried with myself the
    anxiety of doing the ideal thing always. to ascertain what was
    ideal however would require me to evaluate a decision in almost
    every perspective i could think of, and not be caught ignorant or
    blind-sided by my inability to broadly or deeply. this process -
    of thinking, analyzing, judging, deciding can get so hopelessly
    complex and difficult that i find myself often being unable to
    make any decision at all. even when it comes to what words to
    choose to just SAY to someone, i find myself vexed by what words
    to choose that would not do injustice to what i see in myself, in
    the other, and everything in between me and them. often, different
    actions and words are suitable for different values and goals -
    that's when it isn't clear that there is one ideal way
    forward. perspectives, values, ideas, circumstance, all vary and
    change with time. the thing that i want to say might stay the
    same, but circumstances around them and the meanings associated
    with what i feel and want to convey tend to constantly develop as
    time goes on. I see it all happen as i see my feelings and
    perspective of things develop and change as I go through life in a
    state of mourning and grief. I see it, and wish I could convey
    it. But for that i'd need to somehow just sit down and write. Be
    okay with whatever comes out. Just say something, even if i say it
    inadequately, before it is too late. but, acting as if i have
    infinite time, i defer the act of putting words to things for a
    more suitable time, for a time when i am less resigned to the
      currents in the ocean of sadness engulfing me.


      <p>sometimes i realize that my brain might flip some switches
      tomorrow, and refuse to comply with me. on an intellectual
      level, i know of this possibility, but it is only sometimes does
      it really truly viscerally strike me that i might not have as
      much time as i am giving myself. that history is full of people
      who suffered and died in ways that were unexpected,
      debilitating, humiliating, abrupt, and unfulfilling. nobody in
      hiroshima expected the atom bomb. almost nobody in that city had
      expected the brutal and gruesome fate they would meet. life was
      orderly one day, and suddenly everything was beyond horrifying,
      beyond sick, beyond deathly. many suffered the slow
      disintegration of their burnt bodies to radiation for years
      after. One particular man, identified only as "N" by the museum
      of peace in hiroshima was said to have suffered and writhed in
      pain for years, going from doctor to doctor for reprieve from
      his agony. He could not bring himself to passive suffering
      because his family depended on him for food and survival, but
      the more he worked to provide for his family, the more he
      physically suffered. The writing on the museum wall notes that
      he withdrew into his dimly lit room even in the middle of summer
      in August 1951.  It is unclear when he died, but even that did
      not come at a time that was expected or appropriate. It took one
      day for everything around him - his city, his body, his clothes,
      his sense of physical ease in his own body, his family, his
      sense of safety in the world to all get mutilated and stripped
      bare into a long, protracted, and nightmarish struggle to stay
      alive.
      <p>Growing up in a safe and sheltered environment earned and
      created by my parents led me to believe that sanity, safety,
      achievement, growth, progress were all the norm. With these
      variables as predictable and stable, i would extrapolate the
      trajectory of my life into the future and imagine where i want
      to be across a long period of time accordingly. It seemed
      obvious that i would go on to live as long as my parents at the
      very least - what with the increasing average life expectancy of
      the country, the education that i got, and the environment of
      peers in college and school who were making it into stable,
      well-paid jobs, families, and other life milestones with a
      predictable pattern that had often been repeated all around me
      by other people living out their lives through all the years of
      adulthood - a pattern wrought by hard work and constant effort
      in an intensely competitive world.

      <p>At some point, I felt shattered and checked out of this
      all. Exited the dash from one milestone to antoher. Instead, I
      decided to give myself infinite time, if that is what it took to
      recover and heal and feel human again. It was then when i saw
      the true humanity in me emerge - that i got to meander instead
      of race, and in that meandering, give myself the time to exist
      uncompetitively, to exist compassionately and kindly. To do
      things out of a secure knolwedge of what matters to me instead
      of doing things out of some twisted search for an answer to
      pain, disappointment, cynicism. That led to my having discovered
      love and good health, before losing them all over again. 
      
      <p>So on one hand, I am conscious of how little time I might be
      given by nature and fate. On the other hand, I am conscious of
      how much time it takes to grieve, mourn, recover, and find a
      place of compassion and love once again after being utterly
      shattered. Picking myself up tends to be a very slow and arduous
      process for me - requiring me to wait months, years to learn to
      trust myself and the world again. on the other hand, I see the
      flurry and speed with which things happen all around me - how
      quickly circumstances change from one to another. How quickly
      time runs out.

      <p>I'm not sure what to do with this contradiction. Do I give
      myself the time to find the right words to express? Or just
      express myself to others while i still can before it is too
      late? I'm not sure. I just don't want it to be too late - for me
      or anyone i know to live with open questions about how i truly
      felt about them. So I hope i find the right words somehow, and
      soon.

<hr>
  <p> you'll find me switching tabs on my laptop, trying to find a
    place on the internet which i can inhabit, psychologically. not
    really succeeding. despite the glut (of everything) on it, i
    struggle to find any of it worth "consuming". The recommendation
    algorithms have not done me any justice. I was told that their
    dangers lay in entrapping people in a bubble suited to them,
    making it harder for them to access ideas or media that makes them
    uncomfortable. How I wish that were true. I would have given
    anything for a comfortable bubble like this over the last month as
    i retreated from the world into a shell in which I hoped to find
    safety - both physical and psychological. Needs that become
    prominent in the aftermath of surviving a violent physical
    assault. I write the word "violent", finding it strangely
    inadequate to describe what happened. I've read this word so
    often, in newspapers and in philosophical texts that the abstract
    quality of it never really struck me until now. It reads so
    airily. Very unlike the more tangible and hard hitting closed
    fists that shatter facial bones.</p>

    <p>It all started when I was born, sometime in the 90s. A mistake
      by any measure. Full of needs with no idea about what to do
      about them. Especially the need for quiet, in a loud and cramped
      neighborhood with street vendors, barking stray dogs, scooter
      engines, honking cars, hollering children, bargaining aunties,
      pressure cookers, television sets in neighboring rooms, ringing
      doorbells, and so on. Helplessly, I suffered them all in my room
      at my parents' ground floor apartment at a busy street. Day
      after day, year after year. I complained about it to my parents
      sometimes. Especially, about the street vendors out on the
      street, whose early morning bellowing prevented me from sleeping
      in on weekends. In the evening, the sources of noise were so
      varied, that there was nothing to do but just accept it as part
      of life. Reading was out of the question. So was studying
      (despite evenings being the only time when I could). So it had
      to be the tv or the music player. But even those, weren't
      ideal. They just added to an already hyperstimulating and
      frenzied environment. Given the racket in which I was raised, it
      seems like a miracle that I didn't stab my eardrums as a
      child. Growing up deaf might have been kinder. But somehow, I
      persisted, albeit with a strong aversion to noise.


    <p>My only defence against this relentless assault were my
      earphones and the idea that I'd make it out of here someday. And
      I did. As an adult I'd go on to work in LA, a city with ample
      space and quiet. Enough to be able to hear myself think, to read
      books without being disturbed, to look at the sky and idly
      mentally wander. It was a lonelier place. The absence of noise
      was owing to the absence of people in close vicinity. Everyone
      lived in a large expanse and the only unwanted sound that really
      bothered me was that of the occasional footsteps of my upstairs
      neighbors. Despite the isolating quality of the newfound
      silence, I cherished it for what it gave me - a space to be just
      me. The opportunity to fill it with sounds of my own liking, not
      with the intent to drown out other louder sounds that i'm being
      involuntarily subjected to, but with the intent to compliment
      the quiet of the place. My stay there wouldn't last however. My
      ears had found reprieve, but my gut was going to act up. The
      latter did not take well to the american food microbiome. Pains
      of the stomach presented themselves and unable to find adequate
      and responsive healthcare in that country, I took the last
      flight out of there (right before the pandemic) and came back to
      the same old neighborhood. This time it was quieter than
      before. The lockdowns and quarantines ensured no activity
      happened on the street. So I could cherish some time in my room
      and hear the birds chirp, grateful to be back in such
      circumstances. this was 2020. As the pandemic subsided
      (thankfully along with my gut pains) and regular life resumed, I
      found myself slowly acclimating back to the regular noise of the
      area once again. This time, in 2021, I had a car which I could
      use to drive me to quieter places in the city - forests,
      meadows, parks, richer neighborhoods, art galleries, and more
      often than any other place, to A's apartment. It's where I went
      to hear what was music to me; A's laugh, and to listen to the
      sounds of A's voice - soft, and kind. Embodying everything
      endearing about her - gentle, kind, and curious - always. Words
      won't do it justice. Maybe you'll run into her some day and hear
      it for yourself. She lived in a quiet residential neighborhood
      removed from the market, right in front of a park with lots of
      trees which you could see from the balcony. That place, in
      retrospect, was a haven. I found refuge in it, visiting it every
      week to be suffused with her warm and gentle presence. Soaking
      in it, till i felt full and benign as she was. The world outside
      came through in muted tones - with only just enough volume as it
      made sense for it to. What was closer, and what i had always
      hoped to be closer to, was close; the sounds of A and her friend
      singing together to their favorite songs late at night, as i sat
      there, absorbing the miracle that was happening in my life. I
      sat there, containing my delight, marveling at the realization
      that i was privy to something as beautiful and loving as
      this. Beautiful in every sense of the word. Loving because what
      else could allow for that to happen. I'm not sure I got to tell
      them what that meant to me. If they knew what kind of a feral
      creature i was before this, driven to a maddening frenzy by the
      noise of life, finally hearing something humane. The rigid
      neuroticisms I carried in my psyche effortlessly dissolving on
      meeting the soft hum of their voices. I knew nothing about the
      world. What it meant to be a friend, to invite someone into a
      place of my own, for dinner, and then let them partake in the
      choir of my spirit. I was older than them by age, but there i
      felt like a child who was just beginning to discover what really
      mattered in life. I saw the contortions of my mind that had till
      then only learned to compete, compare, and achieve - in a
      meaningless procession to nowhere, for nothing, all in an empty
      vacuous dance to briefly impress myself or someone else. It
      wasn't just that I couldn't sing. I didn't know how to love
      myself enough to even try. It would require me to like myself
      enough to feel comfortable baring myself that way. I would have
      to come to terms with the ugliness of my scheming heart - which
      had learned to scheme its way through the merciless pandemonium
      of its life. Why, had I not learned this? To be simple, kind,
      caring, and loving? When had i become so self-interested and
      small in pursuing my desires? Was I always like this? I don't
      know. But hearing A and her friend hum to each other made it
      clear what really mattered to me. I might have never known that
      if I hadn't encountered A. But I knew then why we all care to
      live at all. A question that had remained open to me throughout
      the dreary senseless struggle that it otherwise seemed.

      <p>My delight at this discovery wasn't absolute however. It was
	marred by the presence of an internal voice that i hadn't
	listened to in a while. Reminding me of persistent
	dissatisfactions - with myself, with life. Reminding me that I
	had yet to reconcile with what I'd done to get here. My
	reckoning was due. And it would come two years later.

  <hr>
  <p> sitting with relatives, looking at an infant, deferring job
  applications, browsing the web, talking to parents, going for walks,
  bathing, sitting in cabs, buying earplugs, looking for used cars,
  doing all this with the latent hope that i will eventually drag
  myself to this place once again and somehow find a way to tell you
  about all the times i find myself remembering her, and grieving the
  gruesome demise of our relationship, leading towards estrangement
  and ultimately severance. Tell you, with the hope that this process
  of articulating a comprehensive exposition will lay bare something
  fundamental and humane about it all. finally allow me to understand
  why it turned out this way - find the human beneath what seem like
  unconscionable actions on my part. and with that human, approach the
  world outside my room once agian.</p>


  <p> Debilitated by grief on almost every front, the comfort and
  solace offered by my bed and Fiona Apple singing across the universe
  seems too great to renounce for my awkward and ungraceful attempts
  to find the human in me. and so, large amounts of time are spent
  listening to the song on long walks, hoping to eventually find a
  broader and deeper recognition of the truth about my past. and the
  truth about someone, i think, is always always human. nobody is
  biblically evil. at most one is biologically and socially
  aberrant. there are no "bad people". only those who haven't been
  understood yet. everyone has a story. the truth about people is
  always humane. and i think i see that in others (in most people in
  my everyday life at least). so I'm not sure why i can't seem to see
  it in myself. it might exonerate me from the hideousness of my
  current self-perception, and bring about acceptance and rest. it
  might allow me to make sense of why things happened the way they
  did. make sense of how two people who want the absolute best for
  each other, and care deeply for each other, fall apart in a way as
  heart-rendingly painful as me and she did.. but despite this, i
  remain adrift of the clarity needed for compassion.

    <p>maybe this is expecting too much. as someone who is broken,
    both figuratively and literally, I'm not sure why i believe my
    involuted thinking will somehow lead me to clarity and
    realization. i'm not sure why i expect to myself to get anywhere
    in this endeavor, why i believe i have the tools or capacity for
    such an abstruse and difficult effort this in my current state. my
    memory is of no help, and my brain fails me often. even in mundane
    everyday tasks. Yet, i remain compelled to try, likely because
    everything broken usually has an unbroken origin and one only
    needs to trace the shattered part in time and space and feel it to
    sense what might have happened. children are innocent. adults are
    not. it's unclear what happens in between, but the memory of that
    transition is always in the person. maybe i just need to look
    within and retrace my steps with honesty and humility.

      <p>or maybe it's somewhat different than that. maybe the issue is
      not being "broken" (psychologically) but being "dirty"
      (viscerally) . Almost nobody likes to be dirty - physically, or
      in the conscience. Most people seem to go to great lengths to
      clean themselves and rationalize their actions. The urge to be
      clean seems very primal. To want trust that one can do things
      again without spreading dirt and disease - act freely once again
      on being clean, say "yes. this is what happened. now it is
      fine. now i know better" - having identified the dirt in one's
      history and separated it from the self-concept, allowing for
      conviction and belief to act clearly once again.

  <hr>
    <p>on some of my late night walks out in the desolate and decrepit
    neighborhood of my home, i find myself looking at the sky and
    asking what it was all for.. if there was a god, why he would
    allow things to happen the way they did. in what world is it ok to
    subject someone to this. to the year of 2023. in what world does
    it make sense for anyone to have a year like that. memories of my
    world from that time come to me and remind me why i care so little
    for life anymore. make me indignant and angry - at anything and
    everything that has ignorantly failed to account for what has
    transpired in my head. on the street i see someone feed a few
    stray dogs, the kind of dogs that barked at me in 2023. with no
    zest for life, or inclination to preserve it anymore, i pick a
    fight with both the dogs and the feeders, prepared to perish if it
    comes to that. i could do the dignified thing and channel my
    discontent in a more civil way. but civility went out the window
    in 2023. it means very little now, just like any other human value
    emerging from a deep seated protectiveness for life and reverence
    for its preciousness. for lack of a better word. whatever
    preciousness it held went out the window too in that same year.

      <p>genie was there for me. i remember squatting outside on the
      street, pouring a bottle of water over my head to mark how
      utterly screwed i felt. mentally in a bender so divorced from
      normal, with no sight whatsoever of being okay anytime soon. no
      clue what was happening to me. just helplessly going on walks
      late at night, trying to think and process the crazed psychic
      events of the day. doing that night after night after night. all
      by myself. I'd sometimes look at the moon for solace but then
      I'd see bad things happen on it. not sure why. not sure what was
      the point of that. if a god exists, why would he do that. if he
      doesn't, why bother living with such horrors that have no
      meaning. horrors that are torturous and beyond violating. genie
      was with me, following me because I'd pet its tailbone. it used
      to shake and tremble initially, but over several weeks of
      petting it, it became calmer. genie became calmer and more
      confident. she came into her own through all the months i spent
      walking the streets and parks in my neighborhood trying to find
      solace after whatever psychic torture i had gone through on that
      particular day. genie, a honeycomb, a bat, and a Peepal
      tree. some things that provided solace through it all. although
	even the sight of genie felt violating on some days.

	<p>after all this while, why cling to those memories. why
	bring them back to mind. what point is there in thinking about
	a horrifying ordeal. why not forget it and move on. rebuild
	life anew and start over. i guess my prevailing disregard for
	life, the reasons for which seem inscrutable to everyone
	around me, stems from knowing that at some point i fought
	tooth and nail to "build" something for myself and that it led
	nonetheless to a place so tortured and crazed that I'm not
	sure what else to believe in anymore. all meanings of life
	have now been forfeit. what remembers are baser
	instincts. hunger. sleep. thirst. lechery. and the one thing
	that inexplicably continues to exert its pull - the want to
	write things down. to not die before the truth, my truth has
	been conveyed somehow. I'm not sure what that would
	achieve. nobody will hand me a job, a million dollars, and her
	hand in marriage after seeing how deep went the rabbit hole of
	my fall. materially it might do nothing for me. but without
	having written it down, it will continue to inhabit the
	fringes of my memory, reminding me that just like before,
	everything can be torn down into senseless agonized insanity
	and violating mental torture. and that there is nothing i
	would be able to do except silently bear it, in my room, on
	the road out late at night, in a hospital, until a different
	set of medications were found to work. I'd rather it be
	seen. let this evil be known so that it doesn't continue to
	prey at me, or at others in darkness. they have a word for
	it. but i don't trust people with words of the sort. many
	people think that having the name for something and knowing
	its definition in a dictionary imparts them the knowledge of
	what it means. i can say "the dismemberment of a psyche, of a
	relationship" and you might solemnly commiserate with me, as
	if you know a thing about what that entails. there will be a
	finality of misunderstanding between us when i give you the a
	word, a phrase for what happened. but the events in my life
	that that phrase represents and what that experience was like
	in full would remain uncommunicated, remain with me just as
	before - in the fringes of my memory - unseen and
	un-understood by you and the world at large. and if i cannot
	convey my experience and myself to you, then what is the point

	that happened in 2023, then what is the point of anything at

    <hr>
<p>i never knew that saying the truth would be so difficult. the ways in
which i end up saying it sound dated and melodramatic. it is an
undeniably sad phase of my life. i had a disease some time back which
makes one tear one's own mind apart. when i was sick with it, it did
the same to me, or rather, i did the same to me. among the things
dismembered during that time was my sense of meaning and
language.. words became disjointed from meaning and everything became
senseless... among the things dismembered during that time was also my
relationship with someone who meant the world to me. it seems a bit
unusual to write that. not many would describe the end of a
relationship that way. but i guess the gruesomeness of how it happened
in my case, merits this phrasing. i have said the word "dismembered"
and anyone reading this would think they know what the word means. but
really only she and i know what it was like. she and i who don't talk
anymore. so i sometimes lay in my room, wondering how to convey the
sadness of a precious world ending that way. before it ebbs away from
memory with time.

  <p>i guess to convey the truth about how much it hurts to watch someone
leave, it would require me to convey what they meant to me in the
first place. so that they mean to you what they mean to me, so that
then you can register their loss the way i do. i don't think i have
the ability to do that - to give words to how i feel about the time
when she confided in me that bougainvilleas are spiritual to her. when
she shed a tear on seeing a pine tree for the first time. how someone
who is no longer in your life used to look at you who meant the world
to them. how you used to look at them, and hug them, as they meant the
world to you. a shared world that has now ended. a world that was mine
that is now ended. what can i say to tell you how much it hurts. it
seems to be the norm - for relationships to come to an end. maybe
yours has too at some point. so it might be easy to think that you
understand. but what if the world you shared with someone else met a
particularly gruesome and painful end. a long protracted depression
that brought grief over and over until whatever love was felt could
not possibly justify it. until all the meanings of care and
affirmation were betrayed and all the positive meanings shared in that
world were now perverted into something shameful and wrong. why did it
have to turn out this way, i find myself asking .. nobody in
particular. thin air. trying to piece together different parts of an
inscrutable puzzle that keeps changing the more i look at it...

    <p>i talk in ways abstract and meandering because detailing the gory
demise of this world would not do justice to how it affected the
people involved. how it affected me at least, and continues to do
so. i don't have the ability to write in a way that is pithy. that
does justice to the true nature of things. so in my room i just lay,
waiting to find a moment when the grief has subsided enough to let me
pick up the laptop and start somewhere. fraught with a million
different neuroses and aversions of self-awareness, i try to give
words to things. but each time i find that conveying the truth is not
easy at all. what then was my education all for? i learned to think
and write critically of things, but not to speak about what i want to
most of all. analyzing the similes and metaphors in the rhyme of the
ancient mariner in high school. underlining words and answering
questions at the end of the chapter. never had i known I'd be at such
a loss in finding a way to convey myself. to undo an estrangement. it
might have been easier if i knew the simple truth about myself, so
that i can present it to them and let it be. knowing that everything
that could be done has been done. but "myself" is so bent beyond
measure, that every day is a struggle to untwist the twisted and see
the simple human beneath it all. but i cannot yet. so i remain guilty,
and unaccepting of myself, unable to present the human and expect
compassion and reconciliation. estranged indefinitely from someone who
means the world to me as i mean lesser and lesser to them.

    <p>-----


      <p>things that would help. a clear understanding of the past
with which to reconcile. a sense of purpose with which to weather the
sadnesses of what has been done. the first eludes me despite my
efforts towards it. the second i actively evade despite its necessity
in my life. in my room, i imagine what exists outside it - a
deteriorating city, relatives in perpetual wait for me to take flight,
the passage of time as the world moves on from one life milestone to
another. the imminent certainty of everyone i have ever loved starting
their own respective families with other people, have children with
them, and "building" their own pristine cocoon worlds in the chaotic
mess of life in this country. i lay still, unwilling to move in any
direction until i have figured things out, until i have made sense of
who i was and why i did what i did. use somebody. it seems. i want to
say that i didn't. but i do not know how else to look at it. until i
find a humane way to look at this, every movement of my limbs will
appear ugly and vain. nothing good can come from movement of a body so
utterly plagued with self-alienation. murderers, dictators, terrorists
- all have story to tell with which they justify themselves, through
which they find the conviction to do what they do. a murderer doesn't
decide one day to "murder someone". they look at someone within the
context of their lives and act to affect them for reasons known to
them, reasons that come out in a journal, a courtroom, a confession
box. the same can be said for any heinous man. behind murder is
usually hate. behind theft is usually deprivation. what then is behind
using someone as an object. what human element precedes something like
that. I'm not sure. but I'm in search of that. so that i can see
myself as just another human once again. until then, I'm a heinous
creature, residing in the realm of the bad, the wicked, the sick
beyond measure. unable to reach out once again to the estranged and
make amends. unable to ask for compassion and reconciliation. writhing
in isolation.


	<p>international by sweet trip plays in my head. a memory of her talking
to me on a video call as i lay on the floor of an apartment in San Jose
comes to me. 


	  <p>maybe something pure exists at the bottom of it all. the truth, human
and simple - unlike the wicked distortions of the current
perspective. "did i really do that?" i ask myself, or did i just think
of doing that at some point? what was i thinking? i am not
evil. nobody is. everyone does something for a reason. what was mine,
i try to recall. days spent in the dim yellow lights of a room poorly
ventilated, spent thinking and processing and trying to remember the
true nature of things at the bottom of it all. days turning to weeks,
to months, years.. circling around the ever-elusive truth at the
bottom of it all, obscured behind years of mental contortions of a
psyche trying to cope.

	    <p>"Youkoso Hitori Bocchi" plays in my head. Naku Naku Naku.

	      <p>I just now realized that I've become a hikkikimori. Much like how i
was back in undergrad - hiding from everyone out of awkwardness and
the pain of being perceived as a weirdo with no sense of social grace
and understanding. Perpetually lonely and yearning for contact with
someone who accepted the bizarre, contorted, and self-abnegating
psyche that i was. i remember watching an anime called "welcome to the
NHK" about a reclusive shut in who was so severely struck with social
anxiety that just the thought of a human interaction would be hard to
grapple with. it resonated with me - given my own issues with social
anxiety. every interaction with a human not my immediate relative was
fraught with the piercing awareness of all the ways in which i was
"failing" at being normal, graceful, and at ease. So I'd withdraw into
the internet and its strangely voyeuristic and pornographic view of
things. Seeing everybody but never being seen. Lonely, lonely, beyond
lonely - days, months, years of loneliness. Each year brought the
depressing realization that another had been spent in isolation and
loneliness. That's when i watched this anime- "welcome to the NHK" the
protagonist of which was named "Satou" who i strongly related
to. lonely, reclusive, lonely. looking out of windows with yearning,
with a deprived and wanting gaze. i remember being in grad school. in
my apartment. looking out the window at people passing by, wondering
if any among them would come into my world. one day someone did. she
did. and changed everything. she invited me into hers. introduced me
to the people in her life. hikkikimori no more, i had friends, a life,
a group of people who cared for me. who heard me out over long dinners
they cooked for us. i was part of an "us". she brought that into my
life. the idea of an  "us". i belonged. i belonged. i finally
belonged. through by 800 cherries plays in my phone, sitting on my
chest. I'm trying to tell you that for the first time in my life i
felt like i belonged. in 2021 and 2022.

		<p>it's 2025. and I'm realizing I'm hikkikimori once again. after the
anger with which i killed the world to which i had belonged. and the
desperation with which i tried to salvage it after the fact.

in my room once again, in my default state of unbelonging, trying to
belong once again if not to her, to them, then to myself. trying to
belong to myself by unpacking the elusive truth at the bottom of it
all. why did i do that to someone who brought meaning and love into my
life. why did i use them. what good did i think would have come from
it. how could my conscience permit something that it now refuses
to. what changed. if back in college i couldn't bring myself to leave
the room out of social anxiety, now i can't bring myself to leave it
out of guilt. but the observable material effect is the same. a body
entombed in the dim lights of a room where it is perceived only by
itself. circling back to the default. what comes to mind is the novel
"no longer human" by Dazai that i read in my early 20s. relating to it
back then as an awkward misfit. now as someone with an unconscionable
conscience. i hope i find the human eventually. one with which to
reconcile and present to her, to myself, so that i can start anew and
leave the room. Leave the room. Leave this place. Leave and be
something else. Sometimes my dad will walk into the room and trying
not to push me too hard, will express his desire that i come out some
day, come out and spend time with him. maybe apply to a job that he's
found for me. i don't know what to say. he knows not to wait for a
response and with a smile leaves the room. i think i feel his pain,
watching his son spend his days in a dimly lit room, by himself,
talking to nobody, involved in god knows what, involved in his own
head ever since he lost it years ago. i wish i could tell him that my
interminable stay in my room will come to an end. that i do want to go
out into the world, find a job, take everyone out for a dinner, meet
all the relatives who've been asking about me. i wish i could tell him
that i love him and appreciate his care and love for me. but plagued
by an unresolved past, with no answer about when I'll be finally past
it, i stay in my bed, thinking, remembering, grieving, trying to
acclimate to the loss of someone who meant the world to me. trying to
wrap my head around what has happened. trying to get to the bottom of
things and find the human in me, and then present his truth to
himself, to her, to him, to the world, and then leave this room for
good. sometimes my mother comes into the room. she expresses her hope
that i get a job some day and come into my own. i tell her i hope for
the same. but really the concept of a job eludes me. I'm not sure i
have it in me to strive, to toil, to exert, to pierce. more
realistically i don't have it in me to get up in time, gather myself,
put on a suit, apply for a job, wait for an interview, and on getting
one, go to an employer and justify the last 6 years of doing nothing
even remotely close to what can be called meaningful work. and then
somehow be called in to work, to get up in time every day, show up in
an office, talk to people, hope that on that day my mind isn't totally
dysfunctional, and then without any skills whatsoever, try to complete
a single task handed to me. in some world it might be possible, in a
world in which I'm striving and trying to do something. but the world
i inhabit in my room is one in which i have put a pause to doing to
allow myself to observe the passing of thoughts and memories so that i
can eventually find the truth about my past that continues to elude
me. the truth that will make a human out of me again and allow me to
leave the room. leave the room ad try for a job, be visible to myself,
to her, the world, and live more like a human and less like a
hikkikimori.

    <hr>

    <p>i finally have something to say that can break the daunting ceaseless sorrow and misery of this place. that can act as a pause, for you to breathe, for me to tell you that my misery is not pathological but deeply contingent on things that happened that were beyond fucked up.

<p>ok. here's my evidence that I'm not pathologically miserable. 

      <p>after i got violently beaten by 3 guys and left for dead in the 42 degrees blistering heat of a summer afternoon behind a temple, i found myself in the operation theater waiting to get anesthesia for the surgeries that would fix my shattered face. so, waiting in the hospital ward, for the billionth time, for a doctor to pull me out of the dredges of brokenness, i thought of all the ways in which i have destroyed myself over the past few years, kick-starting an episode of grief and depression so intense that i would go on to spend the next two months shut in my room sleeping the entire day and waking up only at night, to go out when nobody else was awake, to walk and talk with the divine. on these late night excursions, i would inevitably get barked and howled at by dogs, sometimes even followed - and so intense was my indignation at having been so brutally and violently deprived of every shred of solace in this cursed and miserable life that i would scream back at the barking dog and dare it to come bite me. if it followed me, i would run /towards/ it, fully prepared for the possibility that it could stand its ground and call my bluff. but each time, the cowards would run. and so i reclaimed the street for myself. emboldened by this win, i would look up at the sky and beseech the creator to help me understand the meaning behind his designs. why i was subject to not just a torturous mental illness, and a violent physical assault, I had to now also bear the guilt of obsessive-compulsively sharing my hateful diary pages with the person i cared for the most. diary pages written years ago in moments of hatred and anger in which i flesh out the most vile, cruel and debasing ideas i have towards someone close to me. now, years later, after being physically assaulted, and suffering a bout of "confession-OCD", i find myself unable to stay at peace without disclosing those pages and therefore sent them. this completed my estrangement with her. it ended whatever there was left with her. so here i was, at 3 AM walking the streets plunging headfirst into bottomless grief - at having lost my career, having lost her, having inflicted the most cruel wound on someone i wanted to protect the most, having lost another year of my life to illness and misery and depression, having lost the last shred of compassion and connection that i evoked in her. having sent the most hateful words to someone whose primary goal in life was to live one full of love and care. having taken on more guilt than any healthy and sane human possibly can. i walked the streets at night, looking at streetlights and two gentle dogs who would give me company in return for me petting them. i would ask them, i would talk to them, because i had lost faith in talking to people. so i would talk to them and ask them "please help me - in any way you can" and ask them questions about just why the hell did she have to suffer. that i would accept all the suffering i had endured over the last few years as some sort of twisted karmic showdown over god finally punishing me for having hurt* someone innocent and loving. but in what world did it make sense for that person to suffer (my hate)? why did she have to bear the piercing and hateful ways in which i saw her. no answers - from the dogs, or from the sky. so I'd sit, exhausted by walking endlessly at night, I'd sit on the side of the road next to Nike and tails. Nike the boy dog and tails the girl dog. I'd sit with them for company and just bear the grief of having lost that which mattered the world to me and then some - good health,  a career, the compassion of someone who meant the world to me, my belief in the world and myself. unable to reconcile with the cruelty of my reality presenting itself to me.

	<p>traumatic brain injury, concussion, severe depression, unemployment, and a memory of being beaten to pulp and left to die be damned. all this be damned. I'd bear it all and accept all this as mine and live to fight another day. but where i found myself utterly failing in coping was realizing that my pain had infected and affected someone else. had affected her. what do i do with that? how can i possibly live with the guilt of knowing I've harmed someone else's spirit and sense of belief in themselves?

<p>"please tell me how you're doing?"
<p>"can i please text you on telegram?"
<p>"how are you doing?"

<p>desperate messages sent on text hoping to hear back and get an idea of how she's doing. watching my estrangement with her become complete in slow motion. no answer to the bottomless despair of things as they stood. I'd go to sleep at 4 AM - stubborn about not seeing the light of day and participate in the activity of working men and women. it would be an insult to the grief i felt if i busied myself about practical matters as if my entire world wasn't collapsing on the inside. endless grief. endless sorrow. wandering the streets late at night, I'd look at buildings half constructed, tree leaves moving slightly in the wind at night, and I'd look at Nike and tails with the desperation of a person who has nowhere else to turn but street animals for answers to his life. answers to questions like "can you please help me with anything at all?". it seemed that they had none. so i petted them. and then eventually left to sleep in my home.

<p>months go by like this, June, July, and august.


  <p>—-

  <p>Come September, I haven't met tails and Nike in weeks. I'm far too busy keeping alive my dear friend esarby who has flown into Delhi from Los Angeles. Taking him to old monuments, forts, palaces, restaurants, cafes, streets that hold personal meaning to me, and everywhere and anywhere he wanted to go in this country - I find myself missing her every single day. thinking how great it would be if she were here with me. if she was here. my world is now expanding again. after bottomless grief, i have been allowed this one joy - the joy of showing my friend around in my own city and eager to not fail, i orient myself to this newfound purpose which is dragging me out of the bottomless pit i was in less than 2 months ago. today, in the 4th week of his stay in this country, i return home in a cab after dinner with him, listening to "the slide song" by "spiritualized, and I reflect on how i have been given the gift of life outside bottomless sorrow once again. that finally something exists that isn't just the endless agony and despair of watching myself become estranged from her and watching my left eye heal from two different surgeries to correct the complications that resulted from a brutal assault. the assault which is now fading from memory because i am far too occupied by the vividness of the present spent with a close friend who has flown in from the other side of the planet to come visit. i am far too occupied with the fullness of life in the presence of someone who has also meant so much to me. if only she were here - i think to myself with an aching heart, realizing that finally we three are in the same city and that there is no conceivable way i can make my dream of having both esarby and her in the same car as me. introducing them to each other and existing in both their company. the dream is incomplete but i feel infinitely grateful that at least something here exists - a friendship - something positive that isn't bottomless sorrow. so on reaching home i decide to go out at night and visit Nike and tails. i see them after 4 weeks. and they are ECSTATIC.

    <p>I pet them excitedly and declare how much i love them and i love them and say to them things like "i lovvvvvvvvvvve you!" and they're excitedly prancing about all around me in the dead of the night huffing and puffing and wagging their tails with mouths wide open with tongues flapping loose as they arch their neck up for their faces to look at me expectantly for the next totally delightful time my hands pet their heads and backs and scratch their necks while i tell them that I love them i love them i love them so damn much and how grateful i am that i have the company of an old friend once again. Nike cannot stop wagging his tail and he's just bouncing and arching and huffing in joy. tails on the other hand is so excited by my petting and stepping all around her while playfully pushing and scratching and petting her that she literally throws up  right in front of me while wagging her tail and her puke comes out in a parabolic arc as she moves her head away from me to eject all the half digested food she has been fed this prior evening. i stop immediately and take stock of how hilarious but also concerning it is. unsure how to react i just let her wander off amusing myself in the strange turn of events. Nike still expects me to pet him. so i keep doing that while tails starts licking her mouth and walking away. realizing that the poor girl got pulled into way too much excitement for her own good, i go to her and pet her again, this time more gently and caringly and affectionately. it is ok. she is hesitant at first but gives in. and now i am petting both these dogs with care and caution and warmth. it is ok. time for a walk.

    <p>so i walk. i walk around the neighborhood at 3AM with Nike. tails is currently taking a moment to relax and chill. Nike is still excited and eager. so he and i are now walking. I'm playing music on my phone. "this must be the place" by talking heads. and as soon as he starts crooning in the song i find myself dancing at the intersection between the park, the school, and the alley of my house. nobody else is here. it is just me experiencing rapture and joy for the first time in what feels like years.  i can sing. she is free. esarby is well fed and comfortable in the Taj. i am healing. i have evidence that i can experience joy. evidence that i am not miserable for the sake of being miserable. that when something, or ANYTHING good happens in my life at all, i register it just fine. so, singing to the tune of "this must be the place" by talking heads and dancing and walking i am followed by Nike all around the neighborhood on the same path i was walking depressedly and mourningly and endlessly in shame and guilt and grief less than 3 months ago. none of my sadnesses have left. i still miss her beyond measure. i still wish she were here. but i know that her absence here makes sense. that it is for the better that she is now outside the shadow of my devastated life. or so i hope. she is free. nothing more to confess. no more damage to acknowledge. all the harm that could've been done has been done. all the guilt that could've been felt has been felt. there's more sorrow to bear up ahead - the slow arrival of the news that she has moved on and found someone else, to be with, marry, have children with, and so on. but that is for another day. where i am in life, it makes sense to celebrate that i had the privilege of enjoying an old friend's company at all given that less than 3 months ago i was in a pit so deep that all i could find myself doing was hatefully cursing whatever semblance of life i encountered on my way through this dastardly neighborhood - the same one i was now walking through with the joy of seeing my beloved stray dogs once again in a moment of gratitude that something good can happen in a life as twisted and depressing as this at all. that there is finally an occasion to write in which i can tell you of something life affirming, tell you something that isn't just about a pit that is infinitely deep.

    <p>provide a picture of a person having found an island of meaning in an endless expanse of sadness and grief. not a one dimensional man this one. the slide song by spiritualized plays in my head.

    <p>-19/11/25 03:46
    <hr>
    
    <p> what's yours is given back to you again. what was mine after
    all. hubris to think that i could give shape to your spirit and
    make it mine. a plaything for a boy with no sense of
    judgment. hubris to think that i could give shape to my spirit,
    base as it was, into something more unconditionally loving. so i
    walk through streets, looking at nooks and crannies where I'd
    imagine us, pained by the thought of going through space and time
    without your presence in it. unsure how much longer it will take
    to acclimate to this. i don't see any end from here. nor do i want
    to. nor do i want to arrive at a place of indifference. i hope i
    don't.

    <p> - 07/09/25 20:02
    <hr>
    
    <p> I'll bear anything. anything at all. as long as i find the
    right words to at least SAY just what the hell that bearing has
    meant to me. nothing worse than just languishing and hurting
    wordlessly, unable to convey to those dear to you how much they
    mean to you, how much you hope to give them the things they've
    given to you. 

    <p>so I'm just here, in my place, waiting for something, something,
      anything, to give, so that i may start speaking again. do justice
      to bottomless sorrows felt over years. unable to let go of them
      because they're the last remnants of things that used to be in
      my life and meant the world to me.

      <p>- 07/09/25 19:57

    <p> in how many ways can you beg providence to not deprive you. in
    how many ways can you beseech it to not take away from you
    something, or someone that once used to be with you. i always knew
    that life would humble me, so i never thought to be arrogant in
    what to expect from it. but did it have to be this bad, this
    cruel. what the hell is the point of trying at all, when despite
    your agonized striving, you find yourself in the exact opposite
    direction of where you had hoped you'd be. "to be kind" and "to be
    loving" and "to reciprocate love" where things i wanted to
    do. fuck. what else have i wanted from it - if not to be close to
    people. then i find myself indignantly demanding providence for an
    explanation for why the most significant thing I've ever done is
    an act of cruelty and hate. Just how can someone with the singular
    and explicit value of reciprocating love, subject someone who
    loves him, to the most gutting act of hatred. what the hell am i
    supposed to make of this irony.

      <p>"live and let live" - i used to tell my parents when they
      fought. "i would never stay with someone i hated", i promised
      myself as a child. this was my philosophy: "if you don't like
      someone, then keep away from them. go somewhere else. give
      yourself the freedom to do so and then live and let live". so
      why is it that i grew up to enchain someone into a relationship
      of admonishment and hate. why didn't i just walk away? why did i
      stay with someone for this long and tolerate what that produced
      in me? for them, for them, for them, is what i think. it was for
      their well-being and what i wanted that i thought to stay for a
      little bit longer. made a deal, with myself and with them,
      setting me up for a reckoning that just doesn't stop.

      <p>returning yourself back to you now. what is mine now after
      all. at some point in the future i will know of your marriage to
      someone else. and i will feel still that there is hope
      maybe. then you might have children with him. and then it will
      dawn upon me that things are really over. i hope at least then i
      will be able to rid myself of the delusion that we both can
      still make things work. registering your loss in slow motion,
      set off by the worst things i could've possibly said, is what
      I'm mired in these days.

      <p>why do i have to foresee all the ways in which my
      actions/words can harm things. just constantly fretting if I'm
      being irresponsible, if I'm miring you into my own pit, which i
      know you still look into every now and then. the more
      responsible thing to do would be to let you go. to /just/
      LET. YOU. GO. but like a stubborn child, i resist doing the
      responsible thing. i spend days, weeks, trying to figure out how
      to reach you still and say what i feel like saying to you,
      without leading you into a destructive and pathological thing
      once again. i want to tell you to not go, but at the same time i
      cannot imagine how you would stay. don't go. but don't
      stay. because your going has been painful. but your staying too
      will hurt too. make me anxious - that i will rope you into
      something i cannot accept - more deprivation. "I'm not
      want-dispenser" you said to me. nobody is. but I'm not sure what
      was so absurd about what i wanted from a partner. from someone
      who says they love me?. i sought to accept you exactly as you
      were, but failed miserably. and i no longer trust my ability to
      make things work. to find satisfaction and joy with you.  so,
      hatefully i cling to the thought of your departure and finding
      again my freedom to seek the bare minimum, while aching
      constantly over not seeing you. not seeing you with me, in my
      car, in my life, in trains i'm taking to visit other cities, in
      nooks and crannies of old forts and ruins. aching over not
      having you to talk to. what does anything even matter if i
      cannot share it with someone who i care about. it's all physical
      matter - devoid of meaning - without love and want.

      <p>at the same time, i don't believe anymore in inviting you or
      anyone into my life. i can scarcely take care of myself, lying
      on my bed, wondering why everything is so hopelessly complicated
      and difficult. wondering how i might reclaim a livelihood and
      the dignity of someone who can support himself. it becomes
      obvious that it will take years. and by then you'll be gone. and
	even if my some freak miracle, i run into a lot of money, i will
	not still know how to make things work. how to accept that you
	remained absent while i disintegrated.

      <p>returning yourself to yourself - maybe that's what you've been
	doing. as much as it pains to know you've not been here, i
	cannot argue against it. at least that saved you from the
	destruction that i experienced. as much as it pains to see that
      you weren't here, i take solace in the fact that at least you
      survived.

      <p>what's yours is given back to yourself again. as agonizing as
      it is. what else is there to do.

    <hr>

    <p>Days pass by. Thoughts and feelings ebb and flow. I miss the
    people who're no longer in my life. I wish I could tell them how
    much I want them still.

      <p>I was thinking of a place where I could leave them letters. Some
      place they can visit. I briefly considered the telegram chats
      I've had with them, and while looking through them, I chanced
      upon a group in which I was sent the following text by someone I
      will call R (whose name is like that of a famous German river). This is her text:

      <p>>"Pulkit, you are intensely invited for a tribal meal at P-99
      the coming week".
      

      <p>I miss R, and her pizzazz. She cooked some very wholesome
      meals for me - introducing me to meats, dishes that I didn't
      even know about before her. She once cooked me a duck, and told
      me exactly which parts of it were tender and rich. Like a little
      boy getting a gift, I happily accepted this knowledge and the
      meal made for me with so much love. I have terrible memory and
      despite that I remember how it looked on my plate. I remember
      tasting it and being delighted by how its texture was completely
      different from anything i had had before. It was juicy, very
      well cooked and seasoned, and put on the plate for me with some
      vegetables on the side. It was a joy. The kind in which I
      secretly felt quite lucky to be the recipient of someone else's
      enthusiasm and connection with food. I remember R and A waiting
      to hear what I had to say about what it tasted like, and when I
      finally told them, I remember them concurring that it was indeed
      like how they appreciated it too. R and A were creating their
      own world of food, inviting me to their dinner every now and
      then. Like a boy who had been let in on a very personal and
	special coterie, I eagerly accepted each invitation.


	<p>I hadn't ever thought of myself as having any special
	interest in food until then. And even now, after R and A are
	in a different place, what I recall more vividly from my time
	spent with them was not just the texture and the taste of that
	duck meat, but more so that someone felt so ardently about
	their food and inviting me(!) into their love and enthusiasm
	for it. I remember how they spent hours in a small kitchen,
	preparing multiple dishes simultaneously, in the humid
	evenings of Delhi while I sat outside on the dining table
	mystified by how someone could be so dedicated towards a
	dinner. My mom has cooked countless meals for me, but I always
	implicitly accepted that as the kind of obvious care that a
	parent exhibits towards a child - something I would only
	understand when/if i ever became a parent myself. But here I
	saw someone roughly my own age persevere and sweat to make a
	meal just the right way and then feel excited about sharing it
	with me - that was quite mind-blowing to me. What's even more
	amusing and maybe even a little tragic is that I couldn't
	convey back then how special they had made me feel. I remember
	thanking them profusely for having me over, for cooking the
	delicious dinner, and we hugged before I went home. But I'm
	not sure I could express what a rarity this kind of thing was
	for me. R was used to cooking meals for her family back in her
	home. For both R, and A, sharing food was how they'd always
	expressed care for people. But for me that was completely
	new. It was with them that the reverence people had for
	breaking bread with a visitor dawned on me. Somewhere deep
	down I resolved to reciprocate their love.</p>


	<p>This is me writing about it, with the hope that some day
	they will stumble upon this place, and know that I still feel
	grateful and lucky to have lived that dinner. This is also me,
	reliving that memory while telling you about it and realizing
	now how nice it is to do that.</p>


	<p>Speaking of which, when I'd go to these dinners, A and R
	would recount older memories of their life to each other,
	sharing all the peculiarities of that time, of their past
	selves, of others around them, that resulted in the weird and
	fun admixture of experience they were sharing. I remember
	listening intently, excited to hear about their time in
	school, in college, and with each other from before I knew
	them. Sometimes I'd be amused, sometimes I'd be surprised at
	how different they were to anyone else I had known, but still
	eager to lend an ear so that I could get to know them
	better. And how could I not! R recounted her stories with so
	much pizzazz, so much panache that I couldn't help but me
	captivated. The energy and fervor with which she recounted
	events from her past was unparalleled by anyone else I knew. I
	suspect that the secret to her vitality was sugar. She used to
	carry chocolates in her pockets and had an unabashed and
	unapologetic affinity for sweet things. This was diametrically
	opposite to my own disposition - which was tempered by the
	weary distrust of added sugar as something that is generally
	not very "healthy". But with R, it was what gave her life. The
	elixir to her youth. In my own past, I had spent countless
	hours consuming internet discussions about the myriad ways in
	which added sugar affects one's health poorly, eventually
	inducing in me a weary abstinence towards it. "Another thing
	to avoid I suppose" I'd sigh to myself. R on the other hand
	delighted in chocolates of all sorts and would constantly hand
	them out to me or anyone in her vicinity! Back then I couldn't
	comprehend it. I even tried persuading her to consume less of
	it. But I was such a fool! It was me who had yet to understand
	how sweet it is to share a sweet with someone. How wonderful
	it feels when someone who truly truly loves a chocolate, draws
	one out from the pocket of their coat, and extends their hand
	out flat towards you with a piece of it on their palm. As if
	earnestly saying, "Come frolic with me".</p>


	<p>I hope she reads this some day. I hope she finds out some
	day that the word "ebullient" makes sense to me only in the
	  context of her. </p>


	  <p>All this while, I've spoken about the intense trip of
	  being in R's company. But all this while with us, was A. It
	  was A who had introduced me to her friend R. It was A who
	  often helped R with cooking, and often prepared dinners for
	  us both. Baked chicken, with broccoli, mushrooms, and
	  carrots. I think I'm missing one or two more accompaniments
	  here. But I'm sure as I recount A's presence at that dining
	  table with R and me, I'll recall what they were. She'd
	  usually sit right next to me at the dining table,. Something
	  that immediately comes to my mind is just how gracefully she
	  would eat. Always with a closed mouth, inhaling and exhaling
	  deeply with her nose, and eyes sometimes rolling upward as
	  she savored a delicious thing. Her plate would always be
	  super-clean, unlike mine which would have little streaks of
	  gravy and bits and pieces of food waiting to be picked
	  up. Her plate, even while she was eating, would cut a
	  cohesive and graceful picture. Food collected in a neat
	  manner, picked up gently with her fingers in neat
	  strokes. And perhaps the most loving thing anyone has ever
	  culinarily done for me - she'd sometimes pick different
	  parts of the dish from her plate, combine them in a bite,
	  and then offer it to me - inviting me to partake in the idea
	  she just had. Like a mini meal while having the main
	  meal. I'd always accept, tasting it, and then while eating,
	  nod to her about it being a particularly nice combination
	  indeed.

	    <p>A is the person who would look at me put olives in
	    yogurt and still go "I believe in you". Her friend from
	    college, who I'll call "SNG", once saw me come up with
	    that combination with a look that i can only describe as
	    the gestural equivalent of
	    well-whatever-floats-your-boat-i-guess. A on the other
	    hand extended encouragement and support. While she learned
	    how to prepare sumptuous and filling meals like kasundi
	    fish with bok choy, coriander chicken curry with rice, and
	    oatmeal with litchi, pomegranate and mango slices, I was
	    coming up with silly combinations like: walnut Gobi with
	    hummus, mushroom paneer bhurji with coriander, blueberry
	    coriander dip with rice, coconut spinach curry, and potato
	    egg roll.


	      <p>Yes. If you're feeling perplexed then that's probably
	      evidence that you're a sane human being with a probably
	      well-calibrated understanding of flavor. I, err, am not
	      sure if I was. I guess it was my own naive attempt at
	      experimenting in the kitchen and trying to be creative
	      and playful. I don't remember making these dishes more
	      than once. But when I shared them with A, she would
	      express amazement and delight - telling me how delicious
	      these dishes sounded. She could truly, <i>truly</i> get
	      behind me on almost all of my misadventures with
	      food. I'm not sure what I did to earn such unwavering
	      trust, but I'm grateful that I had a chance to be privy
	      to it. Not all of my dishes were as experimental. Often
	      they were just as simple as khichdi. A trusty and
	      reliable fallback for days when either of our stomachs
	      were acting up. Comfort food. Shared in a round steel
	      dabbi. For some inexplicable reason, A would delight in
	      it. I'd be perplexed, not knowing how one could relish
	      something as simple as khichdi as much as she did. But
	      that perplexity would eventually give way to the relief
	      that there was at least one thing I could make to
	      reciprocate for all the times she painstakingly
	      assembled a complicated dish just so that I could try it
	      out. All that while I would just be amazed that someone
	      could go to such lengths just to introduce me to a
	      food. It was only years later, through a series of
	      epiphanies and revelations, would I come to realize what
	      it meant to her. And what, in the desert that I now inhabit,
	      it has come to mean to me.

    <hr>
<p> What I wouldn't give to be able to say something directly and
convey exactly what I mean to. I think I can do that to some extent
when speaking to people IRL, but when it comes to making it all pass
through text, I end up being able to produce nothing but bloated and
tortuous sentences. I don't know how I developed this tendency. I
can't stand reading the things I've written. They're insufferably
wordy. "Just say the damn thing!" I think to myself. I want to convey
the things i experience. But giving you the bare facts of the matter
won't do it justice. Just like the final scene of any movie is
meaningful to anyone only in the context of everything that came
before it, the things i experience today carry any meaning to me only
in the context of everything that has happened until today. So I feel
like i must tell you everything, give you the entire context of my
world before divulging the events of today. So I try to replicate here
on text, the context that exists in my head. But each time I put
letters to what i think, it comes out as this engorged, bloated
mess. Just what the fuck.

<p> It might help if i knew from where to start. Novels, movies,
  music, all have distinct, specific starting points. If i go back in
  my memory, the starting point is somewhere in my childhood. I'd have
  to tell you everything i recall from the earliest memory till
  now. It would take a while. Since I do not have any training in
  writing a narrative, what I produce in text might be a
  ramble. Yes. That's usually what it is. That's what bothers me about
  blogging. I produce rambles that go nowhere, that ultimately say
  almost nothing. Exactly like this one.

  <p>I'm forever skirting the topic at hand. Trying to figure out a
  way with which to approach it so that i can do it justice. But more
  often than not, I end up doing something more tedious and airy -
  like speak about my psyche in a "meta" and analytical way. I don't
  know where i picked up this tendency. Maybe reading too much of a
  particular writer. The one that comes to my mind - I should name
  him. To ground this text in something real and tangible. But I don't
  want to. I don't even want to tell you anything about them. Because
  you could be a mean internet person who judges people based on their
  literary past. If you think that's absurd, if you're thinking "who
  does that?", then congratulations - your mind is still in working
  shape - still unfucked by the cutting, hateful gaze of the person
  i'm currently imagining - the person who lives inside my head. It's
  actually not one person exactly - it's an amalgam of many - but one
  of them is so spiteful, so contemptuous, so hateful and cold that
  you could tell them anything about yourself, anything at all, and
  what you'd get in return would be a judgment on you and your
  experience. Delivered with confidence and and certainty. As if they
  have already figured you out. As if they know what you are all about
  and what you're saying. And sometimes, only sometimes, they might
  say something relevant and helpful, which might coax you into
  believing that they really do know what they're saying and therefore
  take them seriously. But it's a mistake. You'd have then
  internalized a lie. Nothing is as simple as it seems. Everything is
  hopelessly complex. But this amalgam of curious readers which lives
  inside my head comprises of some who're armed with the ability to
  reduce this complexity. This can be extraordinarily helpful when
  done with benign intentions. We all want to understand what is
  happening to us and get on with our lives. Nobody wants to be lost
  in a labyrinth with no means of navigating through it. If I had this
  ability, I'd be able to just say the thing I want to! But this same
    ability wielded by a cynical psyche can disintegrate everything.

    <p>There are many ways of looking at things. Not all are
    right. Some are plain wrong. Some are misleading (either by
    accident, or deliberately so). Some are just misguided. Most ways
    of looking at things fall short of characterizing reality and the
    true nature of things. Lots of philosophy has been dedicated to
    figuring out how to speak of things with certainty, without
    ambiguity, and truthfully. Entire schools of thought centuries old
    still exert their influence on young people, (including younger
    me) who're looking to <i>understand</i> things. That was the
    dominant idea/motivation in my life in my 20s. You might believe
    me when I say this - but I really wanted to understand the world
    when I was young. You might even nod in agreement at that as an
    understandable sentiment. "Young people want to make sense of the
    world and be capable in it". In a vacuous, trivial, general way
    that is true. But that's also horse-fucking-shit. There is no
    general nature to things. Most philosophy is bullshit. Yes it
    helps you question your assumptions and think critically. But it
    doesn't necessarily bring you "closer" to "understanding" the
    world in any real way. If anything, it obscures and mystifies
    everything by reproducing in your head, the mental gymnastics of
    the philosophers who were writing. And you, thinking these writers
    as smart and renowned might get fooled into thinking that they are
    onto something. But really, the only thing they're onto is a frame
    they inherited. Just ONE way of looking at things. The one
    informed by the people they read, the people who raised them, the
    people of their time, their mentors, etc etc. Which is
    fine. Everyone has influences. But for some reason (I'm yet to
    figure out why), we approach books written by these popular
    hotshot writers with googly eyes. As if they know any damned thing
    about our lives, our selves, our conditions. As if they know
    anything even about their OWN life, their OWN selves, their OWN
      conditions.

    <p> Maybe I'm being too cynical. There might be people out there
    who're writing from their heart. Who're writing simply, with
    innocent eyes, about their life. I know only one such person. Who
    is so pure and beautiful and mentally unfucked by the wicked and
    twisted ways of people I've met. who writes from their heart
    basically. But there are many others who I've encountered who
    write to .. <i>dominate</i>(?) reality. to churn it in their
    mental processes (inherited from their influenced) and draw from
    it a pithy and profound and platonically true way of looking at
    things. And then, use that supposedly pithy/profound/true
    perspective to ascend to a position of power or repute in social
      matters and then get what they want.


    <p> I did this.

    <p>In the short term, it worked. It paid off. I got what I
    wanted. But the distortions it produced in my head, the way it
    warped my sense of reality and truth imposed a punishment on me so
    severe that I have yet to figure out a way to describe it in
    language. It destroyed me, in ways I am yet to recover from. Now I
    walk and talk in circles, trying to figure out how to say the
    truth again - if not to others, then at least to
    myself. "Pathetic", you might think - of someone who has lost grip
    on reality. Who cannot distinguish truth from falsehood. And yes,
    it is a very pathetic place to be in. That's exactly why i don't
    speak of it concretely. Because if i were to do that, then it
    would make you feel sorry for me. But that is not my intention. My
    intention is to give you the truth. And since i have lost the
    ability to seek it due to what i've done, I can at best meander in
    circles or other ways until i accidentally chance upon it again,
    until i accidentally discover the grooves of a truthful and honest
    psyche and then follow that to return to being a sane and sensible
    human. Until then I'm totally mentally fucked - doomed to speak in
    airy rambles about this or that. Unable to speak from the heart or
    say anything tangible.

      

      <p> I think there was a time when i had a clear well calibrated
      mental mechanisms with which to parse and digest reality. This
      was before I abused them to serve my hideous ends. They were
      stellar (in retrospect). Surgical and precise. Logical and
      clear. There was no piece of literature immune from my attempts
      to understand it. Given enough time and interest, I would look
      and read the words presented to me by others and digest them to
      produce what i thought they wanted to say. Well, everyone does
      this in some way I guess. But I'm speaking of a time in my life
      when I used to be able to do it unusually well. Unusually well
      compared to now. Now the same mechanisms/tools in my mind are
      blunted and shattered, destroyed after they turned on
      themselves. Unable to reconcile with what I'd used them to
      do. Like a computer program stuck in some recursive loop that
      crashes everything else around it. Imagine a defunct machine in
      an old bureaucratic building that nobody knows what to do
      about. That nobody wants to forcefully turn off or unplug to
      risk losing whatever important function it fulfills in the
      network of machines it is attached to. 


	<p>Have you ever seen a computer program written with the
	purpose to delete itself? There is a certain elegance to that
	thought, that idea. There's an recursive simplicity to it. But
	why would anyone write such a thing? As a joke perhaps. Or
	just to see if one can make such a thing happen.


	<p>Now imagine if that computer program was written instead to parse
	files and process them. less elegant, but bear with
	me. imagine if included among all the files it parses and
	processes, is also the file on which itself is written. So
	this computer program is examining and processing itself
	too. And in the process of doing that, accidentally ends up
	deleting itself. Less elegant now.


	  <p>What if while parsing its own file, it encounters an error
	  instead, a bug, and programmed to reprogram itself, it
	  starts editing and rerunning the executable it produces from
	  its file after deleting sections of its own code and writing
	  newer code in itself to handle errors and exceptions. What
	  if it also starts editing files that are critical to the
	  operation of the computer on which it is running, and then
	  re-running itself. Sounds like a very sophisticated program,
	  a bit dangerous it seems. At this point you might ask, "what
	  is it trying to achieve? Lets assume it was written to
	  answer your questions by searching for it through all the
	  files on the computer on which it is running and on all the
	  computers it is connected to. These files happen to include
	  the file on which it is written and the system files on the
	  operating system. Would you trust such a program on your
	  machine? If you could read the file on which it is written
	  but lacked the programming knowledge required to infer its
	  mechanisms. It's transparent, but inscrutable to you. Would
	  its transparency inspire trust? Or would it depend on where
	  you got it from. What if it was already running on the web
	  where you found it and started interacting with it, without
	  realizing how it was running and what files it was reading
	  or editing. So you're not really sure where it came from. It
	  just exists, like any other thing on the web. It gives you
	  answers and is useful to you until you realize it's editing
	  everything on your computer. You're unsure how to shut it
	  down. So it keeps running on the web, occasionally running
	  into errors and restarting itself. Maybe you used it a few
	  times and found it amusing and useful, but now after seeing
	  it crash and delete files critical to you, you're less
	  likely to use it. So you don't use it now. Now it just runs
	  endlessly, recursively editing itself and rerunning itself
	  to become functional and useful again, but now it has
	  changed so many files (including the files that tell it the
	  distinction between an error and a valid output) that it
	  bears no resemblance to its original instructions and is
	  just stuck processing and editing files in ways that are
	  inscrutable and strange, but you're not sure how to fix it
	  because you're not a programmer and you don't know how to
	  shut it down.

    <hr>
    <p>you'll find me walking outdoors late at night, asking
      questions to unravel the mystery that is my past. The vast
      majority of which lies behind the events of 2023.

      <p>Since then I've been building all my intuitions about the world
      and myself anew. As if I've been reborn and now need to figure
      out the world all over again. Health insurance, purchasing a new
      car, finding a different job, doing the bare minimum at the one
      i have, or even putting words to what i think. It all feels
      overwhelmingly complex. When I look around myself for help, I
      find people in my friends and family have some approximate
      intuitions, guiding principles, and a mental map on how to
      navigate these terrains. Techniques, methods, ideas on how to
      overcome challenges. I seem to have lost all of mine. So I rely
      heavily on others for the time being. Taking lots of help, and
      trying to assimilate all their cognition into mine to get a
      better grip on how to do things. But when it comes to finally
      making a decision and doing something, I end up getting
      stuck. Unable to tell the true value of things, I end up not
      knowing which way to go. So I postpone the decision to a later
      date. And meanwhile, do what comes most easily to me - rest.

      <p>I know that I can't do this forever. Eventually I will need to
      leave this cocoon of inactivity in which i have wrapped
      myself. But I still need time in this place. Everything outside
      it seems confusing and meaningless to me until I've figured out
      the answer to some questions that plague my mind. Each of them
      posed by the painful memories of a depressing time made worse by
      decisions that i now no longer understand. "Why the hell did i
      do that?" I think to myself on one of these late night walks,
      but cannot figure it out. It would help if i had a better memory
      of my thoughts and feelings from before - so that I could piece
      together who i was in order to give myself a satisfactory
      answer. But I am extraordinarily forgetful - especially so of
      everything preceding 2023. I could refer to what I've written in
      my journals, or go back to the messages from before. But doing
      so engulfs me in the pain of regret at not having acted
      differently. It shows me the painful "what"'s but not the
      desired "why"'s. Its the latter I want. if I know why it all
      turned out the way it did, I might then know what to do
      differently and then correspondingly avoid ending up in the same
      place as 2023 again. Then I might know what to tell everyone
      about why I was gone. Then I might feel sure of myself in
      returning to everyday life, with an answer for everything that
      happened.
      

<p> I know all this is oblique. I'm dancing around the raw facts of
      what happened - sordid as they are. I'd rather you have them
      with the knowledge of what preceded them - both in real life in
      my head, with all the context that any painful travesty
      deserves. So I walk - in my head and out in the dark night - in
      circles mostly to slowly come around to that context, piecing it
      together so that i can one day give it to everyone here who
      hears about all the unconscionable things i have said and done.

    <p> i've thought a lot about how to structure this site. in what order should i present everything to you? most pages on the internet present things in the "latest comes first" way. That's the default. Even here. But there's an issue with this. You'll read this page from top to down. this means you will encounter what i have to say to you in the reverse order of time. But that is not how i've lived at all. Seemingly innocuous discrepancy, but utterly vexing for someone who wants to tell you his story in real time.


    <p>Also, this isn't exactly in reverse order. This section is written in chronological order. I'm writing this as time is moving forward and you are reading this as time is moving forward. But eventually this section will end. There will be a horizontal line. And then you will jump further <i>backwards</i> in time and then read that section chronologically too. So it's half-reverse-half-forward.

      Unlike a novel. In which everything flows forward. Simple and straightforward as any story should be.

    <p> i would not mind depression nearly as much, if at the very
    least it would not deprive me of the goddamned words with which to
    describe it. bottomless grief, felt over and over. to what end?
    what do i do with this?

      <p>these days i'm in the Goldilocks zone of sadness.

      <p>it's the zone of being when the sadness isn't so overwhelming
      that it leaves me at an utter loss of words, but also hasn't
      waned to the point that speaking about it is complicated by
      other feelings and realizations.

      if i look into it for long enough, i find myself submerged,
      deluged, engulfed all over again. and then there's nothing to do
      but wait, and go for a walk somewhere to bear it.

      sometimes i get to look at it from some distance (but not too
      much) that allows me to tell you a little about it. that's the
      place from where i'm writing. it's not ideal however. it's easy,
      in this place, to inadvertently mischaracterize what it was like
	to be deluged.

	i also am wary of speaking to you like a typical "writer". i
	am writing this on my laptop yes, but i'm not "writing" (as in
	the activity in which one sits down with the explicit purpose
	of composing a text to look at and admire and feel good about
	oneself and one's achievement). I sure as fuck don't intend to
	do the latter. If I'm putting anything up here on this blog,
	it is only to just tell you things.

    <p>you'll find me walking outdoors, sometime around 2AM, looking
    at trees catching a breeze or two. it's quieter, and nicer. there
    is a gentleness to things. there's more stillness. it seems like a
    place that imparts adequate dignity to the presence of someone
    carrying a painful memory. sometimes, when the breeze is just
    right, and when i've lost track of time, lost track of nights
    spent circling the same sadnesses, i'm able to bring myself to
    endure the that memory just enough to see it in a way that's more
    forgiving, and less painful.


      <p>i've been hiding so far. from everyone. from the entire world
      actually. because i do not know how to justify myself in my own
      eyes.  every time i think of appearing in front of the world, i
      imagine that appearance being seen by her, who knows about me
      what the rest of the world doesn't. having seen an excrescence of
      my spirit that was harmful and poisonous.

	eager to extend compassion and
      kindness, you might think that i'm being too hard on myself. but
      there is a realm of humanity which is considered undeserving,
      maybe rightfully so, of any understanding. when i'm out on a
      walk late at night, it is to find understanding for something in
      that realm.


      <p>i talk in indirect ways. not stating anything clearly. it's
      only because i'm yet to figure out how to speak clearly and
      directly without immediately losing any compassion or
      understanding of myself. what good is it to speak without those
      two qualities. without which, i will only end up doing what i've
      done my entire life. curse myself. be pained, frustrated,
      and angry at myself. even hateful. i don't want that to be your
      reward for having given me your time and attention. i'd rather
      just talk in circles until i've figured out how to explain
      everything. so there. i'll be talking in circles. not forever i
      hope. just until i know how to speak about the unspeakable.

	<p>when i'm by myself, i'm just me. beset with myriad
	sadnesses. but still in the company of someone who can give
	  himself all the time in the world to come around to his life.

	  but when i am in the company of anyone else, i feel
	  intensely responsible for their time. so to avoid the
	  embarrassment of subjecting them to my tedious and winding
	  rambles, i defer revealing anything about myself to some
	  other day, some other person, some other time. this happens
	  all the time.

	  <p>it wasn't always like this. i knew someone who looked at
	  me with so much kindness and care that no matter how long it
	  took me to get to the point, they would listen with the just
	  the same amount of curiosity as if i had just begun
	  talking. absorbing everything into the marrow of their
	  being. and with the weight of everything i have said to
	  them, would somehow unfailingly find a softer and kinder way
	  of looking at it all.

	  <p>what do you imagine is the sensible thing to do when one
	  finds someone like this? Hold onto them for dear life?
	  Protect and cherish them? Find a way to reciprocate that is
	  just as endearing and beautiful as them?

    <p>you'll find me in the bed that i made years ago, struggling to
    find words for what i've felt and done. grapes of wrath, flowers
    of evil, an unforgiving chimera tearing everything to pieces. </p>
      <p>i'm sorry. for all the havoc and pain.</p>
      <p>i was sick. am sick. but convalescing now, amid the detritus of a life that once had more order, meaning and love...and now with the lingering memories of someone who is now somewhere else - in a boat, rowing conscientiously, towards a better place hopefully.</p>

      <p>here's a song that reminds me of them, and their capacity to feel and express love.</p>
      <audio controls>
   <source src="la_vie_en_rose_3xvol.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
   the song is "la vie en rose", first sung by Edith Piaf in 1935.
      </audio>

      <p>other times, I find myself walking in little parks late at night, singing the following song to myself...

	a melody to commemorate sorrow, felt on observing all the wounds inflicted by a creature lashing out in pain:</p>

   the song is komm susser tod: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuQzHGcsjlA

      <p>this song is called "komm susser tod" (come sweet death), and is sung by Julia Chahayed who i found here on the web. thanks for visiting.  in time there might be more here. i'm not
      sure. till then, you're invited to visit what younger me was
	like <a href="https://pulkit12083.github.io"> in 2022</a>. </p>
