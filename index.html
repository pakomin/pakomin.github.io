    <p>you'll find me switching tabs on my laptop, trying to find a
    place on the internet which i can inhabit, psychologically. not
    really succeeding. despite the glut (of everything) on it, i
    struggle to find any of it worth "consuming". The reccomendation
    algorithms have not done me any justice. I was told that their
    dangers lay in entrapping people in a bubble suited to them,
    making it harder for them to access ideas or media that makes them
    uncomfortable. How I wish that were true. I would have given
    anything for a comfortable bubble like this over the last month as
    i retreated from the world into a shell in which I hoped to find
    safety - both physical and psychological. Needs that become
    prominent in the aftermath of surviving a violent physical
    assault. I write the word "violent", finding it strangely
    inadequate to describe what happened. I've read this word so
    often, in newspapers and in philosophical texts that the abstract
    quality of it never really struck me until now. It reads so
    airily. Very unlike the more tangible and hard hitting closed
    fists that shatter facial bones.</p>

    <hr>

    
      
    <p>It all started when I was born, sometimes in the 90s. A mistake
      by any measure. Full of needs with no idea about just what to do
      about them. Especially the need for quiet, in a loud and cramped
      neighborhood. Street vendors, barking dogs, scooter engines,
      honking cars, hollering children, bargaining aunties, pressure
      cookers, television sets in neighboring rooms, loud doorbells
      ringing unpredictably at every hour. Helplessly, I suffered them
      all in my room at my parents' ground floor apartment at a busy
      street. Day after day, week after week, year after year. I
      complained about it to my parents sometimes. Especially, about
      the street vendors out on the street, whose early morning
      bellowing prevented me from sleeping in on weekends. In the
      evening, the sources of noise were so varied, that there was
      nothing to do but just accept it as part of life. Reading was
      out of the question. So was studying (despite evenings being the
      only time when I could). So it had to be the tv or the music
      player. But even those, weren't ideal. They just added to an
      already hyperstimulating and frenzied environment. Given the
      racket in which I was raised, it seems like a miracle that I
      didn't stab my eardrums as a child. Growing up deaf might have
      been kinder. But somehow, I persisted, albeit with a strong
      aversion to noise.


    <p>My only defence against this relentless assault were my
      earphones and the idea that I'd make it out of here someday. And
      I did. As an adult I'd go on to work in LA, a city with ample
      space and quiet. Enough to be able to hear myself think, to read
      books without being disturbed, to look at the sky and idly
      mentally wander. It was a lonelier place. The absence of noise
      was owing to the absence of people in close vicinity. Everyone
      lived in a large expanse and the only noise that really bothered
      me was that of the occasional footsteps of my upstairs
      neighbors. Despite the isolating quality of the newfound
      silence, I cherished it for what it gave me - a space to be just
      me. The opportunity to fill it with sounds of my own liking, not
      with the intent to drown out other louder sounds that i'm being
      involuntarily subjected to, but with the intent to compliment
      the quiet of the place. My stay there wouldn't last however. My
      ears had found reprieve, but my gut was going to act up. The
      latter did not take well to the american food microbiome. Pains
      of the stomach presented themselves and unable to find adequate
      and responsive healthcare in that country, I took the last
      flight out of there (right before the pandemic) and came back to
      the same old neighborhood. This time it was quieter than
      before. The lockdowns and quarantines ensured no activity
      happened on the street. So I could cherish some time in my room
      and hear the birds chirp, grateful to be back in such
      circumstances. this was 2020. As the pandemic subsided
      (thankfully along with my gut pains) and regular life resumed, I
      found myself slowly acclimating back to the regular noise of the
      area once again. This time, in 2021, I had a car which I could
      use to drive me to quieter places in the city - forests,
      meadows, parks, richer neighborhoods, art galleries, and more
      often than any other place, to A's apartment. It's where I went
      to feel nourished. To hear her laugh, and to listen to the
      sounds of voice - soft, kind, and sweet. About as feminine as it
      can be, and embodying everything endearing about her - gentle,
      kind, and curious - always. Words won't do it justice. Maybe
      you'll run into her some day and hear it for yourself. She lived
      in a quiet residential neighborhood removed from the market,
      right in front of a park with lots of trees which you could see
      from the balcony. That place, in retrospect, was a haven. I
      found refuge in it, visiting it every week to be suffused with
      her warm and gentle presence. Soaking in it, till i felt full
      and benign as she was. The world outside came through in muted
      tones - with only just enough volume as it made sense for it
      to. What was closer, and what i had always hoped to be closer
      to, was close; the sounds of A and her friend singing together
      to their favorite songs late at night, as i sat there, absorbing
      the miracle that was happening in my life. I sat there,
      containing my delight, marveling at the realization that i was
      privy to something as beautiful and loving as this. Beautiful in
      every sense of the word. Loving because what else could allow
      for that to happen. I'm not sure I got to tell them what that
      meant to me. If they knew what kind of a feral creature i was
      before this, driven to a maddening frenzy by the noise of life,
      finally hearing something humane. The rigid neuroticisms I
      carried in my psyche effortlessly dissolving on meeting the soft
      hum of their voices. I knew nothing about the world. What it
      meant to be a friend, to invite someone into a place of my own,
      for dinner, and then let them partake in the choir of my
      spirit. I was older than them by age, but there i felt like a
      child who was just beginning to discover what really mattered in
      life. I saw the contortions of my mind that had till then only
      learned to compete, compare, and achieve - in a meaningless
      procession to nowhere, for nothing, all in an empty vacuous
      dance to briefly impress myself or someone else. It wasn't just
      that I couldn't sing. I didn't know how to love myself enough to
      even try. It would require me to like myself enough to feel
      comfortable baring myself that way. I would have to come to
      terms with the ugliness of my scheming heart - which had learned
      to scheme its way through the merciless pandemonium of its
      life. Why, had I not learned this? To be simple, kind, caring,
      and loving? When had i become so self-interested and small in
      pursuing my desires? Was I always like this? I don't know. But
      hearing A and her friend hum to each other made it clear what
      really mattered to me. I might have never known that if I hadn't
      encountered A. But I knew then why we all care to live at all. A
      question that had remained open to me throughout the dreary
      senseless struggle that it otherwise seemed.

      <p>My delight at this discovery wasn't absolute however. It was
	marred by the presence of an internal voice that i hadn't
	listened to in a while. Reminding me of persistent
	dissatisfactions - with myself, with life. Reminding me that I
	had yet to reconcile with what I'd done to get here. My
	reckoning was due. And it would come two years later. 

	

<p> April? February? Cannot tell when. Probably all of the months in the first half of 2023.  I must have walked the streets endlessly, pained by what I was,
how much I had betrayed what i thought i valued. I had, like an
artificial computer program, mimicked all the words, affects, and
stlyizations of romance. But I knew nothing of love. I knew only
mimicry - which i had presented not just to A but to many others
too. On baring it to her, I saw it for what it was. How small it
was. I couldn't figure out how to reconcile myself with
myself. Overwhelmed with grief and pain, I sought an explanation
inside me, for why i was that way. So, feeling judged and hurt, and
judged some more and hurt some more, I grieved endlessly. A was her
usual self. But I couldn't stand the pain of what i saw inside me. I
sought an explanation but none came. I walked in circles, mentally and
physically, for months in my own neighborhood. Until something in me
gave out. Something slipped. And then suddenly everything was
terrifying. Even the tip-toe of a crow on my balcony's banister would
terrorize me. The crows would sound as if they shrieked, directly at
me. Even the sound of water dripping on the aluminium case of my air
conditioner would send me over the edge. Any unpredictable sound that
I could not account for would rattle me in every sense of the word. I
prayed, prayed for peace, for repireve from the terrors I was
experiencing. I sought help but could not find a way to explain what
was happening to me. I spoke at length to everyone about what simple
sounds were doing to me but somehow it did not convince anyone. Not
even the doctors who were supposed to. I'd been given something to
swallow. Which I did, very diligently, to the very end. But it only
made everything worse. They were utterly adrift of everything
happening to me. Even those most dear and close to me. My own once
loving parents saw me with nonchalance and irritation. "What had
gotten into this boy?". My father tried to get the dripping water on
the air conditioner sorted. But none of us could tell the birds of the
neighborhood to tip tap more gently on our balcony banisters. I shut
the doors and put on headphones, hoping to inure myself from the
maddening terror that every little sound made. But it was not going to
help. I could hear through the doors, through the walls, through the
headphones, all the noise from outside - at full volume. At some point
my neighbor decided to get his gate fixed. He called a welder to
hammer some metal rods into it. My head felt like glass. And each time
I heard the blow of the hammer, that glass would shatter all over
again. and again. and again.  "How long will this take?" I desperately
asked him from my balcony, to which he'd reply "at least 2 days". I
ran. Like a rabid dog, from neighborhood to neighborhood in search of
a quiet place. seeking reprieve from the brutal aural assault of the
world. Finding none. I would invariably come back to my own and hide
inside an empty bathroom clasping my ears shut, hoping for it all to
subside. It would, only temporarily, at nights. At night I felt sane
again. It was quiet. People were asleep. I could exist and think like
a human again. The frenzy had died out. So It was at night that I
would leave the house to walk outdoors and search for an answer to
this newfound misery. I'd look towards street lights, imagining their
white light as some bodily fluid falling and coming straight towards
my face. I tried to walk away. Walking is all I could do, with the
hope that i would eventually figure out what was happening to me. Even
  if it took years. There was no other way. 


<p>- 09/08/25 - 23:43

    <hr>
    <p>you'll find me walking outdoors late at night, asking
      questions to unravel the mystery that is my past. The vast
      majority of which lies behind the events of 2023.

      <p>Since then I've been building all my intuitions about the world
      and myself anew. As if I've been reborn and now need to figure
      out the world all over again. Health insurance, purchasing a new
      car, finding a different job, doing the bare minimum at the one
      i have, or even putting words to what i think. It all feels
      overwhelmingly complex. When I look around myself for help, I
      find people in my friends and family have some approximate
      intuitions, guiding principles, and a mental map on how to
      navigate these terrains. Techniques, methods, ideas on how to
      overcome challenges. I seem to have lost all of mine. So I rely
      heavily on others for the time being. Taking lots of help, and
      trying to assimilate all their cognitions into mine to get a
      better grip on how to do things. But when it comes to finally
      making a decision and doing something, I end up getting
      stuck. Unable to tell the true value of things, I end up not
      knowing which way to go. So I postpone the decision to a later
      date. And meanwhile, do what comes most easily to me - rest.

      <p>I know that I can't do this forever. Eventually I will need to
      leave this coccoon of inactivity in which i have wrapped
      myself. But I still need time in this place. Everything outside
      it seems confusing and meaningless to me until I've figured out
      the answer to some questions that plague my mind. Each of them
      posed by the painful memories of a depressing time made worse by
      decisions that i now no longer understand. "Why the hell did i
      do that?" I think to myself on one of these late night walks,
      but cannot figure it out. It would help if i had a better memory
      of my thoughts and feelings from before - so that I could piece
      together who i was in order to give myself a satisfactory
      answer. But I am extraordinarily forgetful - especially so of
      everything preceding 2023. I could refer to what I've written in
      my journals, or go back to the messages from before. But doing
      so engulfs me in the pain of regret at not having acted
      differently. It shows me the painful "what"'s but not the
      desired "why"'s. Its the latter I want. if I know why it all
      turned out the way it did, I might then know what to do
      differently and then correspondingly avoid ending up in the same
      place as 2023 again. Then I might know what to tell everyone
      about why I was gone. Then I might feel sure of myself in
      returning to everyday life, with an answer for everything that
      happened.
      

<p> I know all this is oblique. I'm dancing around the raw facts of
      what happened - sordid as they are. I'd rather you have them
      with the knowledge of what preceeded them - both in real life in
      my head, with all the context that any painful travesty
      deserves. So I walk - in my head and out in the dark night - in
      circles mostly to slowly come around to that context, piecing it
      together so that i can one day give it to everyone here who
      hears about all the unconscionable things i have said and done.


      
      <p>- 03/08/2025 03:26AM
    
    <hr>
    <p> i've thought a lot about how to structure this site. in what order should i present everything to you? most pages on the internet present things in the "latest comes first" way. That's the default. Even here. But there's an issue with this. You'll read this page from top to down. this means you will encounter what i have to say to you in the reverse order of time. But that is not how i've lived at all. Seemingly innocuous discrepancy, but utterly vexing for someone who wants to tell you his story in real time.


    <p>Also, this isn't exactly in reverse order. This section is written in chronological order. I'm writing this as time is moving forward and you are reading this as time is moving forward. But eventually this section will end. There will be a horizontal line. And then you will jump further <i>backwards</i> in time and then read that section chronologically too. So it's half-reverse-half-forward.

      Unlike a novel. In which everything flows forward. Simple and straightforward as any story should be. 
      
    <hr>
    <p> i would not mind depresion nearly as much, if at the very
    least it would not deprive me of the goddamned words with which to
    describe it. bottomless grief, felt over and over. to what end?
    what do i do with this?

      <p>these days i'm in the goldilocks zone of sadness.

      <p>it's the zone of being when the sadness isn't so overwhelming
      that it leaves me at an utter loss of words, but also hasn't
      waned to the point that speaking about it is complicated by
      other feelings and realizations.

      if i look into it for long enough, i find myself submerged,
      deluged, engulfed all over again. and then there's nothing to do
      but wait, and go for a walk somewhere to bear it.

      sometimes i get to look at it from some distance (but not too
      much) that allows me to tell you a little about it. that's the
      place from where i'm writing. it's not ideal however. it's easy,
      in this place, to inadvertently mischaracterize what it was like
	to be deluged.

	i also am wary of speaking to you like a typical "writer". i
	am writing this on my laptop yes, but i'm not "writing" (as in
	the activity in which one sits down with the explicit purpose
	of composing a text to look at and admire and feel good about
	oneself and one's achievement). I sure as fuck don't intend to
	do the latter. If I'm putting anything up here on this blog,
	it is only to just tell you things. 


      <p>- 28/07/2025 4:03

      

     <hr>
    <p>you'll find me walking outdoors, sometime around 2AM, looking
    at trees catching a breeze or two. it's quieter, and nicer. there
    is a gentleness to things. there's more stillness. it seems like a
    place that imparts adequate dignity to the presence of someone
    carrying a painful memory. sometimes, when the breeze is just
    right, and when i've lost track of time, lost track of nights
    spent circling the same sadnesses, i'm able to bring myself to
    endure the that memory just enough to see it in a way that's more
    forgiving, and less painful.


      <p>i've been hiding so far. from everyone. from the entire world
      actually. because i do not know how to justify myself in my own
      eyes.  every time i think of appearing in front of the world, i
      imagine that appearance being seen by her, who knows about me
      what the rest of the world doesn't. having seen an excresence of
      my spirit that was harmful and poisonous.

	eager to extend compassion and
      kindness, you might think that i'm being too hard on myself. but
      there is a realm of humanity which is considered undeserving,
      maybe rightfully so, of any understanding. when i'm out on a
      walk late at night, it is to find understanding for something in
      that realm.


      <p>i talk in indirect ways. not stating anything clearly. it's
      only because i'm yet to figure out how to speak clearly and
      directly without immediately losing any compassion or
      understanding of myself. what good is it to speak without those
      two qualites. without which, i will only end up doing what i've
      done my entire life. curse myself. be pained, frustrated,
      and angry at myself. even hateful. i don't want that to be your
      reward for having given me your time and attention. i'd rather
      just talk in circles until i've figured out how to explain
      everything. so there. i'll be talking in circles. not forever i
      hope. just until i know how to speak about the unspeakable.

	<p>when i'm by myself, i'm just me. beset with myriad
	sadnesses. but still in the company of someone who can give
	  himself all the time in the world to come around to his life.

	  but when i am in the company of anyone else, i feel
	  intensely responsible for their time. so to avoid the
	  embarrassment of subjecting them to my tedious and winding
	  rambles, i defer revealing anything about myself to some
	  other day, some other person, some other time. this happens
	  all the time.

	  <p>it wasn't always like this. i knew someone who looked at
	  me with so much kindness and care that no matter how long it
	  took me to get to the point, they would listen with the just
	  the same amount of curiosity as if i had just begun
	  talking. absorbing everything into the marrow of their
	  being. and with the weight of everything i have said to
	  them, would somehow unfailingly find a softer and kinder way
	  of looking at it all.

	  <p>what do you imagine is the sensible thing to do when one
	  finds someone like this? Hold onto them for dear life?
	  Protect and cherish them? Find a way to reciprocate that is
	  just as endearing and beautiful as them?

	  <p>-28/07/2025 - 03:51

    <p>you'll find me in the bed that i made years ago, struggling to
    find words for what i've felt and done. grapes of wrath, flowers
    of evil, an unforgiving chimera tearing everything to pieces. </p>
      <p>i'm sorry. for all the havoc and pain.</p>
      <p>i was sick. am sick. but convalescing now, amid the detritus of a life that once had more order, meaning and love...and now with the lingering memories of someone who is now somewhere else - in a boat, rowing conscientously, towards a better place hopefully.</p>

      <p>here's a song that reminds me of them, and their capacity to feel and express love.</p>
      <audio controls>
   <source src="la_vie_en_rose_3xvol.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
   the song is "la vie en rose", first sung by Edith Piaf in 1935.
      </audio>

      <p>other times, I find myself walking in little parks late at night, singing the following song to myself...

	a melody to commemorate sorrow, felt on observing all the wounds inflicted by a creature lashing out in pain:</p>

      <p>this song is called "komm susser tod" (come sweet death), and is sung by Julia Chahayed who i found here on the web. thanks for visiting.  in time there might be more here. i'm not
