    <p> i would not mind depresion nearly as much, if at the very least it would not deprive me of the goddamned words with which to describe it. bottomless grief, felt over and over. to what end? what do i do with this?

      <p>these days i'm in the goldilocks zone of sadness.

      <p>it's the zone of being when the sadness isn't so overwhelming
      that it leaves me at an utter loss of words, but also hasn't
      waned to the point that speaking about it is complicated by
      other feelings and realizations.

      if i look into it for long enough, i find myself submerged,
      deluged, engulfed all over again. and then there's nothing to do
      but wait, and go for a walk somewhere to bear it.

      sometimes i get to look at it from some distance (but not too
      much) that allows me to tell you a little about it. that's the
      place from where i'm writing. it's not ideal however. it's easy,
      in this place, to inadvertently mischaracterize what it was like
	to be deluged.

	i also am wary of speaking to you like a typical "writer". i
	am writing this on my laptop yes, but i'm not "writing" (as in
	the activity in which one sits down with the explicit purpose
	of composing a text to look at and admire and feel good about
	oneself and one's achievement). I sure as fuck don't intend to
	do the latter. If I'm putting anything up here on this blog,
	it is only to just tell you things.

    <p>you'll find me walking outdoors, sometime around 2AM, looking
    at trees catching a breeze or two. it's quieter, and nicer. there
    is a gentleness to things. there's more stillness. it seems like a
    place that imparts adequate dignity to the presence of someone
    carrying a painful memory. sometimes, when the breeze is just
    right, and when i've lost track of time, lost track of nights
    spent circling the same sadnesses, i'm able to bring to endure the
    the memory just enough tosee it in a way that's less unforgiving,
      and less painful.


      <p>i've been hiding so far. from everyone. from the entire world
      actually. because i do not know how to justify myself in my own
      eyes.  every time the thought of appearing in front of the world
      occurs to me, i imagine that apperaance being seen by her, who
      knows what the rest of the world doesn't. what i did. eager to
      extend compassion and kindness, you might think that i'm being
      too hard on myelf. but there is a realm of humanity which is
      just considered undeserving, maybe rightfully so, of any
      understanding. when i'm out on a walk late at night, it is to
      find understanding for something in that realm.


      <p>i talk in indirect ways. not stating anything clearly. it's
      only because i'm yet to figure out how to speak clearly and
      directly about it without immediately losing any compassion or
      understanding of myself. what good is it to speak without those
      to qualites. without which, i will only end up doing what i've
      done my entire life. cursing myself. being pained, frustrated,
      and angry at myself. even hateful. i don't want that to be your
      reward for having given me your time and attention. i'd rather
      just talk in circles until i've figured out how to explain
      myself. so there. i'll be talking in circles. not forever i
      hope. just until i know how to speak to you.

	<p>when i'm by myself, i'm just me. beset with myriad
	sadnesses. but still in the company of someone who can give
	  himself all the time in the world to come around to his life.

	  but when i am in the company of anyone else, i feel
	  intensely responsible for their time. so to avoid the
	  embarrassment of subjecting them to my tedious and winding
	  rambles, i defer revealing anything about myself to some
	  other day, some other person, some other time. this happens
	  all the time.

	  <p>it wasn't always like this. i knew someone who looked at
	  me with so much kindness and care that no matter how long it
	  took me to get to the point, they would listen with the just
	  the same amount of curiosity as if i had just begun
	  talking. absorbing everything into the marrow of their
	  being. and with the weight of everything i have said to
	  them, would somehow unfailingly find a softer and kinder way
	  of looking at it all.

	  <p>what do you imagine is the logical thing to do when one
	  finds someone like this? Hold onto them for dear life?
	  Protect and cherish them? Find a way to reciprocate that is
	  just as endearing and beautiful as them?

    <p>you'll find me in the bed that i made years ago, struggling to
    find words for what i've felt and done. grapes of wrath, flowers
    of evil, an unforgiving chimera tearing everything to pieces. </p>
      <p>i'm sorry. for all the havoc and pain.</p>
      <p>i was sick. am sick. but convalescing now, amid the detritus of a life that once had more order, meaning and love...and now with the lingering memories of someone who is now somewhere else - in a boat, rowing conscientously, towards a better place hopefully.</p>

      <p>here's a song that reminds me of them, and their capacity to feel and express love.</p>
      <audio controls>
   <source src="la_vie_en_rose_3xvol.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
   the song is "la vie en rose", first sung by Edith Piaf in 1935.
      </audio>

      <p>other times, I find myself walking in little parks late at night, singing the following song to myself...

	a melody to commemorate sorrow, felt on observing all the wounds inflicted by a creature lashing out in pain:</p>

   the song is komm susser tod: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuQzHGcsjlA

<br>

      <p>this song is called "komm susser tod" (come sweet death), and is sung by Julia Chahayed who i found here on the web. thanks for visiting.  in time there might be more here. i'm not
      sure. till then, you're invited to visit what younger me was
	like <a href="https://pulkit12083.github.io"> in 2022</a>. </p>
