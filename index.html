<a href="https://pulkit12083.github.io">this used to be me</a>

<br>
<br>
Then I discovered psychosis. Everything became weird and intense.
<br>
<br>
Now I'm convalescing, often pained and sometimes hopeful.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Some things I do these days:<br>
- code like an amateur <br>
- walk in arcane patterns<br>
- ruminate of poorer days<br>
- daydream of better days<br>
- lift (not so much)<br>
- talk (to those who listen)<br>

<br>
