    <p> i'll bear anything. anything at all. as long as i find the
    right words to at least SAY just what the hell that bearing has
    meant to me. nothing worse than just languishing and hurting
    worldlessly, unable to convey to those dear to you how much they
    mean to you, how much you hope to give them the things they've
    given to you. 
      
    <hr>
    
    <p> in how many ways can you beg providence to not deprive you. in
    how many ways can you beseech it to not take away from you
    something, or someone that once used to be with you. i always knew
    that life would humble me, so i never thought to be arrogant in
    what to expect from it. but did it have to be this bad, this
    cruel. what the hell is the point of trying at all, when despite
    your agonized striving, you find yourself in the exact opposite
    direction of where you had hoped you'd be. "to be kind" and "to be
    loving" and "to reciprocate love" where things i wanted to
    do. fuck. what else have i wanted from it - if not to be close to
    people. then i find myself indignantly demanding providence for an
    explanation for why the most significant thing i've ever done is
    an act of cruelty and hate. Just how can someone with the singular
    and explicit value of reciprocating love, subject someone who
    loves him, to the most gutting act of hatred. what the hell am i
    supposed to make of this irony.

      <p>"live and let live" - i used to tell my parents when they
      fought. "i would never stay with someone i hated", i promised
      myself as a child. this was my philosophy: "if you don't like
      someone, then keep away from them. go somewhere else. give
      yourself the freedom to do so and then live and let live". so
      why is it that i grew up to enchain someone into a relationship
      of admonishment and hate. why didn't i just walk away? why did i
      stay with someone for this long and tolerate what that produced
      in me? for them, for them, for them, is what i think. it was for
      their wellbeing and what i wanted that i thought to stay for a
      little bit longer. made a deal, with myself and with them,
      setting me up for a reckoning that just doesn't stop.

      <p>returning yourself back to you now. what is mine now after
      all. at some point in the future i will know of your marriage to
      someone else. and i will feel still that there is hope
      maybe. then you might have children with him. and then it will
      dawn upon me that things are really over. i hope at least then i
      will be able to rid myself of the delusion that we both can
      still make things work. registering your loss in slow motion,
      set off by the worst things i could've possibly said, is what
      i'm mired in these days.

      <p>why is it so fucking painful to see all the ways in which my
      actions/words can harm things. just constantly fretting if i'm
      being irresponsible, if i'm miring you into my own pit, which i
      know you still look into every now and then. the more
      responsible thing to do would be to let you go. to /just/
      LET. YOU. GO. but like a stubborn child made hateful by life, i
      resist doing the responsible thing. i spend days, weeks, trying
      to figure out how to reach you still and say what i feel like
      saying to you, without leading you into a destructive and
      pathological relationship again. i want to tell you to not go,
      but at the same time i cannot imagine how you would stay. don't
      go. but don't stay. because your going has been painful. but
      your staying too will deprive me of what i've wanted, the bare
      minimum that i've wanted from this relationship, from the world,
      from women. it makes me anxious - that i will rope you into a
      relationship which i cannot tolerate again. a relationship
      deprived of anything i want from it. "i'm not want-dispenser"
      you said to me. what wants of mine did i oblige you to fulfill?
      what did i want from you? sex? intimacy? a salve to my
      loneliness? is that so evil? did i ever make you "responsible"
      for any of it? Or did i just let you be you and sought what i
      wanted from the world at large in order to avoid making you feel
      pressured to be someone you were not. what is wrong with wanting
      things? from the world, from one's partner. from someone who
      says they love him? i don't know. i sought to accept you exactly
      as you are but failed miserably. and i no longer trust my
      ability to make things work. to find satisfaction and joy with
      you.  so, hatefully i cling to the thought of your departure and
      finding again my freedom to seek the bare minimum, while aching
      constantly over not seeing you. not seeing you with me, in my
      car, in my life, in trains i'm taking to visit other cities, in
      nooks and crannies of old forts and ruins. aching over not
      having you to talk to. what does anything even matter if i
      cannot share it with someone who i care about. it's all physical
      matter - devoid of meaning - without love and want.

      <p>at the same time, i don't believe anymore in inviting you or
      anyone into my life. i can scarcely take care of myself, lying
      on my bed, wondering why everything is so hopelessly complicated
      and difficult. wondering how i might reclaim a livelihood and
      the dignity of someone who can support himself. it becomes
      obvious that it will take years. and by then you'll be gone. and
      even if my some freak miracle, i run into a lot of money, i will
      not still know how to make things work. how to accept that you
      remained absent while i disintegrated.

      <p>returning yourself to yourself - maybe that's what you've been
      doing. as much as it pains to know you've not been here, i
      cannot argue against it. at least that saved you from the
      destruction that i experienced. as much as it pains to see that
      you weren't here, i take solace in the fact that at least you
      survived.

      <p>what's yours is given back to yourself again. as agonizing as
      it is. what else is there to do.

	<p>so go. and just let me suffer.
    <hr>

    <p>Days pass by. Thoughts and feelings ebb and flow. I miss the
    people who're no longer in my life. I wish I could tell them how
    much I want them still.

      <p>I was thinking of a place where I could leave them letters. Some
      place they can visit. I briefly considered the telegram chats
      I've had with them, and while looking through them, I chanced
      upon a group in which I was sent the following text by someone I
      will call R (whose name is like that of a famous german river). This is her text:

      <p>>"Pulkit, you are intensely invited for a tribal meal at P-99
      the coming week".
      

      <p>I miss R, and her pizzazz. She cooked some very wholesome
      meals for me - introducing me to meats, dishes that I didn't
      even know about before her. She once cooked me a duck, and told
      me exactly which parts of it were tender and rich. Like a little
      boy getting a gift, I happily accepted this knowledge and the
      meal made for me with so much love. I have terrible memory and
      despite that I remember how it looked on my plate. I remember
      tasting it and being delighted by how its texture was completely
      different from anything i had had before. It was juicy, very
      well cooked and seasoned, and put on the plate for me with some
      vegetables on the side. It was a joy. The kind in which I
      secretly felt quite lucky to be the recipient of someone else's
      enthusiasm and connection with food. I remember R and A waiting
      to hear what I had to say about what it tasted like, and when I
      finally told them, I remember them concurring that it was indeed
      like how they appreciated it too. R and A were creating their
      own world of food, inviting me to their dinner every now and
      then. Like a boy who had been let in on a very personal and
	special coterie, I eagerly accepted each invitation.


	<p>I hadn't ever thought of myself as having any special
	interest in food until then. And even now, after R and A are
	in a different place, what I recall more vividly from my time
	spent with them was not just the texture and the taste of that
	duck meat, but more so that someone felt so ardently about
	their food and inviting me(!) into their love and enthusiasm
	for it. I remember how they spent hours in a small kitchen,
	preparing multiple dishes simultaneously, in the humid
	evenings of Delhi while I sat outside on the dining table
	mystified by how someone could be so dedicated towards a
	dinner. My mom has cooked countless meals for me, but I always
	implicitly accepted that as the kind of obvious care that a
	parent exhibits towards a child - something I would only
	understand when/if i ever became a parent myself. But here I
	saw someone roughly my own age persevere and sweat to make a
	meal just the right way and then feel excited about sharing it
	with me - that was quite mind-blowing to me. What's even more
	amusing and maybe even a little tragic is that I couldn't
	convey back then how special they had made me feel. I remember
	thanking them profusely for having me over, for cooking the
	delicious dinner, and we hugged before I went home. But I'm
	not sure I could express what a rarity this kind of thing was
	for me. R was used to cooking meals for her family back in her
	home. For both R, and A, sharing food was how they'd always
	expressed care for people. But for me that was completely
	new. It was with them that the reverence people had for
	breaking bread with a visitor dawned on me. Somewhere deep
	down I resolved to reciprocate their love.


	<p>This is me writing about it, with the hope that some day
	they will stumble upon this place, and know that I still feel
	grateful and lucky to have lived that dinner. This is also me,
	reliving that memory while telling you about it and realizing
	now how nice it is to do that.


	<p>Speaking of which, when I'd go to these dinners, A and R
	would recount older memories of their life to each other,
	sharing all the peculiarities of that time, of their past
	selves, of others around them, that resulted in the weird and
	fun admixture of experience they were sharing. I remember
	listening intently, excited to hear about their time in
	school, in college, and with each other from before I knew
	them. Sometimes I'd be amused, sometimes I'd be surprised at
	how different they were to anyone else I had known, but still
	eager to lend an ear so that I could get to know them
	better. And how could I not! R recounted her stories with so
	much pizzazz, so much panache that I couldn't help but me
	captivated. The energy and fervor with which she recounted
	events from her past was unparalleled by anyone else I knew. I
	suspect that the secret to her vitality was sugar. She used to
	carry chocolates in her pockets and had an unabashed and
	unapologetic affinity for sweet things. This was diametrically
	opposite to my own disposition - which was tempered by the
	weary distrust of added sugar as something that is generally
	not very "healthy". But with R, it was what gave her life. The
	elixer to her youth. In my own past, I had spent countless
	hours consuming internet discussions about the myriad ways in
	which added sugar affects one's health poorly, eventually
	inducing in me a weary abstinence towards it. "Another thing
	to avoid I suppose" I'd sigh to myself. R on the other hand
	delighted in chocolates of all sorts and would constantly hand
	them out to me or anyone in her vicinity! Back then I couldn't
	comprehend it. I even tried persuading her to consume less of
	it. But I was such a fool! It was me who had yet to understand
	how sweet it is to share a sweet with someone. How wonderful
	it feels when someone who truly truly loves a chocolate, draws
	one out from the pocket of their coat, and extends their hand
	out flat towards you with a piece of it on their palm. As if
	earnestly saying, "Come frolick with me".


	<p>I hope she reads this some day. I hope she finds out some
	day that the word "ebullient" makes sense to me only in the
	  context of her. 


	  <p>All this while, I've spoken about the intense trip of
	  being in R's company. But all this while with us, was A. It
	  was A who had introduced me to her friend R. It was A who
	  often helped R with cooking, and often prepared dinners for
	  us both. Baked chicken, with broccoli, mushrooms, and
	  carrots. I think I'm missing one or two more accompaniments
	  here. But I'm sure as I recount A's presence at that dining
	  table with R and me, I'll recall what they were. She'd
	  usually sit right next to me at the dining table,. Something
	  that immediately comes to my mind is just how gracefully she
	  would eat. Always with a closed mouth, inhaling and exhaling
	  deeply with her nose, and eyes sometimes rolling upward as
	  she savored a delicious thing. Her plate would always be
	  super-clean, unlike mine which would have little streaks of
	  gravy and bits and pieces of food waiting to be picked
	  up. Her plate, even while she was eating, would cut a
	  cohesive and graceful picture. Food collected in a neat
	  manner, picked up gently with her fingers in neat
	  strokes. And perhaps the most loving thing anyone has ever
	  culinarily done for me - she'd sometimes pick different
	  parts of the dish from her plate, combine them in a bite,
	  and then offer it to me - inviting me to partake in the idea
	  she just had. Like a mini meal while having the main
	  meal. I'd always accept, tasting it, and then while eating,
	  nod to her about it being a particularly nice combination
	  indeed.

	    <p>A is the person who would look at me put olives in
	    yogurt and still go "I believe in you". Her friend from
	    college, who I'll call "SNG", once saw me come up with
	    that combination with a look that i can only describe as
	    the gestural equivalent of
	    well-whatever-floats-your-boat-i-guess. A on the other
	    hand extended encouragement and support. While she learnt
	    how to prepare sumptuous and filling meals like kasundi
	    fish with bok choy, coriander chicken curry with rice, and
	    oatmeal with lichi, pomegranate and mango slices, I was
	    coming up with sily combinations like: walnut gobi with
	    hummus, mushroom paneer bhurji with coriander, blueberry
	    coriander dip with rice, coconut spinach curry, and potato
	    egg roll.


	      <p>Yes. If you're feeling perplexed then that's probably
	      evidence that you're a sane human being with a probably
	      well-calibrated understanding of flavor. I, err, am not
	      sure if I was. I gues it was my own naive attempt at
	      experimenting in the kitchen and trying to be creative
	      and playful. I don't remember making these dishes more
	      than once. But when I shared them with A, she would
	      express amazement and delight - telling me how delicious
	      these dishes sounded. She could truly, <i>truly</i> get
	      behind me on almost all of my misadventures with
	      food. I'm not sure what I did to earn such unwavering
	      trust, but I'm grateful that I had a chance to be privy
	      to it. Not all of my dishes were as experimental. Often
	      they were just as simple as khichdi. A trusty and
	      reliable fallback for days when either of our stomachs
	      were acting up. Comfort food. Shared in a round steel
	      dabbi. For some inexplicable reason, A would delight in
	      it. I'd be perplexed, not knowing how one could relish
	      something as simple as khichdi as much as she did. But
	      that perplexity would eventually give way to the relief
	      that there was at least one thing I could make to
	      reciprocate for all the times she painstakingly
	      assembled a complicated dish just so that I could try it
	      out. All that while I would just be amazed that someone
	      could go to such lengths just to introduce me to a
	      food. It was only years later, through a series of
	      epiphanies and revelations, would I come to realize what
	      it meant to her. And what, in the desert that I now inhabit,
	      it has come to mean to me.

    <hr>
<p> What I wouldn't give to be able to say something directly and
convey exactly what I mean to. I think I can do that to some extent
when speaking to people IRL, but when it comes to making it all pass
through text, I end up being able to produce nothing but bloated and
tortuous sentences. I don't know how I developed this tendency. I
can't stand reading the things I've written. They're insufferably
wordy. "Just say the damn thing!" I think to myself. I want to convey
the things i experience. But giving you the bare facts of the matter
won't do it justice. Just like the final scene of any movie is
meaningful to anyone only in the context of everything that came
before it, the things i experience today carry any meaning to me only
in the context of everything that has happened until today. So I feel
like i must tell you everything, give you the entire context of my
world before divulging the events of today. So I try to replicate here
on text, the context that exists in my head. But each time I put
letters to what i think, it comes out as this engorged, bloated
mess. Just what the fuck.

<p> It might help if i knew from where to start. Novels, movies,
  music, all have distinct, specific starting points. If i go back in
  my memory, the starting point is somewhere in my childhood. I'd have
  to tell you everything i recall from the earliest memory till
  now. It would take a while. Since I do not have any training in
  writing a narrative, what I produce in text might be a
  ramble. Yes. That's usually what it is. That's what bothers me about
  blogging. I produce rambles that go nowhere, that ultimately say
  almost nothing. Exactly like this one.

  <p>I'm forever skirting the topic at hand. Trying to figure out a
  way with which to approach it so that i can do it justice. But more
  often than not, I end up doing something more tedious and airy -
  like speak about my psyche in a "meta" and analytical way. I don't
  know where i picked up this tendency. Maybe reading too much of a
  particular writer. The one that comes to my mind - I should name
  him. To ground this text in something real and tangible. But I don't
  want to. I don't even want to tell you anything about them. Because
  you could be a mean internet person who judges people based on their
  literary past. If you think that's absurd, if you're thinking "who
  does that?", then congratulations - your mind is still in working
  shape - still unfucked by the cutting, hateful gaze of the person
  i'm currently imagining - the person who lives inside my head. It's
  actually not one person exactly - it's an amalgam of many - but one
  of them is so spiteful, so contemptuous, so hateful and cold that
  you could tell them anything about yourself, anything at all, and
  what you'd get in return would be a judgment on you and your
  experience. Delivered with confidence and and certainty. As if they
  have already figured you out. As if they know what you are all about
  and what you're saying. And sometimes, only sometimes, they might
  say something relevant and helpful, which might coax you into
  believing that they really do know what they're saying and therefore
  take them seriously. But it's a mistake. You'd have then
  internalized a lie. Nothing is as simple as it seems. Everything is
  hopelessly complex. But this amalgam of curious readers which lives
  inside my head comprises of some who're armed with the ability to
  reduce this complexity. This can be extraordinarily helpful when
  done with benign intentions. We all want to understand what is
  happening to us and get on with our lives. Nobody wants to be lost
  in a labyrinth with no means of navigating through it. If I had this
  ability, I'd be able to just say the thing I want to! But this same
    ability weilded by a cynical psyche can disintegrate everything.

    <p>There are many ways of looking at things. Not all are
    right. Some are plain wrong. Some are misleading (either by
    accident, or deliberately so). Some are just misguided. Most ways
    of looking at things fall short of characterizing reality and the
    true nature of things. Lots of philosophy has been dedicated to
    figuring out how to speak of things with certainty, without
    ambiguity, and truthfully. Entire schools of thought centuries old
    still exert their influence on young people, (including younger
    me) who're looking to <i>understand</i> things. That was the
    dominant idea/motivation in my life in my 20s. You might believe
    me when I say this - but I really wanted to understand the world
    when I was young. You might even nod in agreement at that as an
    understandable sentiment. "Young people want to make sense of the
    world and be capable in it". In a vacuous, trivial, general way
    that is true. But that's also horse-fucking-shit. There is no
    general nature to things. Most philosophy is bullshit. Yes it
    helps you question your assumptions and think critically. But it
    doesn't necessarily bring you "closer" to "understanding" the
    world in any real way. If anything, it obscures and mystifies
    everything by reproducing in your head, the mental gymnastics of
    the philosophers who were writing. And you, thinking these writers
    as smart and renowned might get fooled into thinking that they are
    onto something. But really, the only thing they're onto is a frame
    they inherited. Just ONE way of looking at things. The one
    informed by the people they read, the people who raised them, the
    people of their time, their mentors, etc etc. Which is
    fine. Everyone has influences. But for some reason (I'm yet to
    figure out why), we approach books written by these popular
    hotshot writers with googly eyes. As if they know any damned thing
    about our lives, our selves, our conditions. As if they know
    anything even about their OWN life, their OWN selves, their OWN
      conditions.

    <p> Maybe I'm being too cynical. There might be people out there
    who're writing from their heart. Who're writing simply, with
    innocent eyes, about their life. I know only one such person. Who
    is so pure and beautiful and mentally unfucked by the wicked and
    twisted ways of people I've met. who writes from their heart
    basically. But there are many others who I've encountered who
    write to .. <i>dominate</i>(?) reality. to churn it in their
    mental processes (inherited from their influenced) and draw from
    it a pithy and profound and platonically true way of looking at
    things. And then, use that supposedly pithy/profound/true
    perspective to ascend to a position of power or repute in social
      matters and then get what they want.


    <p> I did this.

    <p>In the short term, it worked. It paid off. I got what I
    wanted. But the distortions it produced in my head, the way it
    warped my sense of reality and truth imposed a punishment on me so
    severe that I have yet to figure out a way to describe it in
    language. It destroyed me, in ways I am yet to recover from. Now I
    walk and talk in circles, trying to figure out how to say the
    truth again - if not to others, then at least to
    myself. "Pathetic", you might think - of someone who has lost grip
    on reality. Who cannot distinguish truth from falsehood. And yes,
    it is a very pathetic place to be in. That's exactly why i don't
    speak of it concretely. Because if i were to do that, then it
    would make you feel sorry for me. But that is not my intention. My
    intention is to give you the truth. And since i have lost the
    ability to seek it due to what i've done, I can at best meander in
    circles or other ways until i accidentally chance upon it again,
    until i accidentally discover the grooves of a truthful and honest
    psyche and then follow that to return to being a sane and sensible
    human. Until then I'm totally mentally fucked - doomed to speak in
    airy rambles about this or that. Unable to speak from the heart or
    say anything tangible.

      

      <p> I think there was a time when i had a clear well calibrated
      mental mechanisms with which to parse and digest reality. This
      was before I abused them to serve my hideous ends. They were
      stellar (in retrospect). Surgical and precise. Logical and
      clear. There was no piece of literature immune from my attempts
      to understand it. Given enough time and interest, I would look
      and read the words presented to me by others and digest them to
      produce what i thought they wanted to say. Well, everyone does
      this in some way I guess. But I'm speaking of a time in my life
      when I used to be able to do it unusually well. Unusually well
      compared to now. Now the same mechanisms/tools in my mind are
      blunted and shattered, destroyed after they turned on
      themselves. Unable to reconcile with what I'd used them to
      do. Like a computer program stuck in some recursive loop that
      crashes everything else around it. Imagine a defunct machine in
      an old bureacratic building that nobody knows what to do
      about. That nobody wants to forcefully turn off or unplug to
      risk losing whatever important function it fulfills in the
      network of machines it is attached to. 


	<p>Have you ever seen a computer program written with the
	purpose to delete itself? There is a certain elegance to that
	thought, that idea. There's an recursive simplicity to it. But
	why would anyone write such a thing? As a joke perhaps. Or
	just to see if one can make such a thing happen.


	<p>Now imagine if that computer program was written instead to parse
	files and process them. less elegant, but bear with
	me. imagine if included among all the files it parses and
	processes, is also the file on which itself is written. So
	this computer program is examining and processing itself
	too. And in the process of doing that, accidentally ends up
	deleting itself. Less elegant now.


	  <p>What if while parsing its own file, it encounters an error
	  instead, a bug, and programmed to reprogram itself, it
	  starts editing and rerunning the executable it produces from
	  its file after deleting sections of its own code and writing
	  newer code in itself to handle errors and exceptions. What
	  if it also starts editing files that are critical to the
	  operation of the computer on which it is running, and then
	  re-running itself. Sounds like a very sophisticated program,
	  a bit dangerous it seems. At this point you might ask, "what
	  is it trying to achieve? Lets assume it was written to
	  answer your questions by searching for it through all the
	  files on the computer on which it is running and on all the
	  computers it is connected to. These files happen to include
	  the file on which it is written and the system files on the
	  operating system. Would you trust such a program on your
	  machine? If you could read the file on which it is written
	  but lacked the programming knowledge required to infer its
	  mechanisms. It's transparent, but inscrutable to you. Would
	  its transparency inspire trust? Or would it depend on where
	  you got it from. What if it was already running on the web
	  where you found it and started interacting with it, without
	  realizing how it was running and what files it was reading
	  or editing. So you're not really sure where it came from. It
	  just exists, like any other thing on the web. It gives you
	  answers and is useful to you until you realize it's editing
	  everything on your computer. You're unsure how to shut it
	  down. So it keeps running on the web, occasionally running
	  into errors and restarting itself. Maybe you used it a few
	  times and found it amusing and useful, but now after seeing
	  it crash and delete files critical to you, you're less
	  likely to use it. So you don't use it now. Now it just runs
	  endlessly, recursively editing itself and rerunning itself
	  to become functional and useful again, but now it has
	  changed so many files (including the files that tell it the
	  distinction between an error and a valid output) that it
	  bears no resemblance to its original instructions and is
	  just stuck processing and editing files in ways that are
	  inscrutable and strange, but you're not sure how to fix it
	  because you're not a programmer and you don't know how to
	  shut it down.

    <p>you'll find me walking outdoors late at night, asking
      questions to unravel the mystery that is my past. The vast
      majority of which lies behind the events of 2023.

      <p>Since then I've been building all my intuitions about the world
      and myself anew. As if I've been reborn and now need to figure
      out the world all over again. Health insurance, purchasing a new
      car, finding a different job, doing the bare minimum at the one
      i have, or even putting words to what i think. It all feels
      overwhelmingly complex. When I look around myself for help, I
      find people in my friends and family have some approximate
      intuitions, guiding principles, and a mental map on how to
      navigate these terrains. Techniques, methods, ideas on how to
      overcome challenges. I seem to have lost all of mine. So I rely
      heavily on others for the time being. Taking lots of help, and
      trying to assimilate all their cognitions into mine to get a
      better grip on how to do things. But when it comes to finally
      making a decision and doing something, I end up getting
      stuck. Unable to tell the true value of things, I end up not
      knowing which way to go. So I postpone the decision to a later
      date. And meanwhile, do what comes most easily to me - rest.

      <p>I know that I can't do this forever. Eventually I will need to
      leave this coccoon of inactivity in which i have wrapped
      myself. But I still need time in this place. Everything outside
      it seems confusing and meaningless to me until I've figured out
      the answer to some questions that plague my mind. Each of them
      posed by the painful memories of a depressing time made worse by
      decisions that i now no longer understand. "Why the hell did i
      do that?" I think to myself on one of these late night walks,
      but cannot figure it out. It would help if i had a better memory
      of my thoughts and feelings from before - so that I could piece
      together who i was in order to give myself a satisfactory
      answer. But I am extraordinarily forgetful - especially so of
      everything preceding 2023. I could refer to what I've written in
      my journals, or go back to the messages from before. But doing
      so engulfs me in the pain of regret at not having acted
      differently. It shows me the painful "what"'s but not the
      desired "why"'s. Its the latter I want. if I know why it all
      turned out the way it did, I might then know what to do
      differently and then correspondingly avoid ending up in the same
      place as 2023 again. Then I might know what to tell everyone
      about why I was gone. Then I might feel sure of myself in
      returning to everyday life, with an answer for everything that
      happened.
      

<p> I know all this is oblique. I'm dancing around the raw facts of
      what happened - sordid as they are. I'd rather you have them
      with the knowledge of what preceeded them - both in real life in
      my head, with all the context that any painful travesty
      deserves. So I walk - in my head and out in the dark night - in
      circles mostly to slowly come around to that context, piecing it
      together so that i can one day give it to everyone here who
      hears about all the unconscionable things i have said and done.

    <p> i've thought a lot about how to structure this site. in what order should i present everything to you? most pages on the internet present things in the "latest comes first" way. That's the default. Even here. But there's an issue with this. You'll read this page from top to down. this means you will encounter what i have to say to you in the reverse order of time. But that is not how i've lived at all. Seemingly innocuous discrepancy, but utterly vexing for someone who wants to tell you his story in real time.


    <p>Also, this isn't exactly in reverse order. This section is written in chronological order. I'm writing this as time is moving forward and you are reading this as time is moving forward. But eventually this section will end. There will be a horizontal line. And then you will jump further <i>backwards</i> in time and then read that section chronologically too. So it's half-reverse-half-forward.

      Unlike a novel. In which everything flows forward. Simple and straightforward as any story should be.

    <p> i would not mind depresion nearly as much, if at the very
    least it would not deprive me of the goddamned words with which to
    describe it. bottomless grief, felt over and over. to what end?
    what do i do with this?

      <p>these days i'm in the goldilocks zone of sadness.

      <p>it's the zone of being when the sadness isn't so overwhelming
      that it leaves me at an utter loss of words, but also hasn't
      waned to the point that speaking about it is complicated by
      other feelings and realizations.

      if i look into it for long enough, i find myself submerged,
      deluged, engulfed all over again. and then there's nothing to do
      but wait, and go for a walk somewhere to bear it.

      sometimes i get to look at it from some distance (but not too
      much) that allows me to tell you a little about it. that's the
      place from where i'm writing. it's not ideal however. it's easy,
      in this place, to inadvertently mischaracterize what it was like
	to be deluged.

	i also am wary of speaking to you like a typical "writer". i
	am writing this on my laptop yes, but i'm not "writing" (as in
	the activity in which one sits down with the explicit purpose
	of composing a text to look at and admire and feel good about
	oneself and one's achievement). I sure as fuck don't intend to
	do the latter. If I'm putting anything up here on this blog,
	it is only to just tell you things.

    <p>you'll find me walking outdoors, sometime around 2AM, looking
    at trees catching a breeze or two. it's quieter, and nicer. there
    is a gentleness to things. there's more stillness. it seems like a
    place that imparts adequate dignity to the presence of someone
    carrying a painful memory. sometimes, when the breeze is just
    right, and when i've lost track of time, lost track of nights
    spent circling the same sadnesses, i'm able to bring myself to
    endure the that memory just enough to see it in a way that's more
    forgiving, and less painful.


      <p>i've been hiding so far. from everyone. from the entire world
      actually. because i do not know how to justify myself in my own
      eyes.  every time i think of appearing in front of the world, i
      imagine that appearance being seen by her, who knows about me
      what the rest of the world doesn't. having seen an excresence of
      my spirit that was harmful and poisonous.

	eager to extend compassion and
      kindness, you might think that i'm being too hard on myself. but
      there is a realm of humanity which is considered undeserving,
      maybe rightfully so, of any understanding. when i'm out on a
      walk late at night, it is to find understanding for something in
      that realm.


      <p>i talk in indirect ways. not stating anything clearly. it's
      only because i'm yet to figure out how to speak clearly and
      directly without immediately losing any compassion or
      understanding of myself. what good is it to speak without those
      two qualites. without which, i will only end up doing what i've
      done my entire life. curse myself. be pained, frustrated,
      and angry at myself. even hateful. i don't want that to be your
      reward for having given me your time and attention. i'd rather
      just talk in circles until i've figured out how to explain
      everything. so there. i'll be talking in circles. not forever i
      hope. just until i know how to speak about the unspeakable.

	<p>when i'm by myself, i'm just me. beset with myriad
	sadnesses. but still in the company of someone who can give
	  himself all the time in the world to come around to his life.

	  but when i am in the company of anyone else, i feel
	  intensely responsible for their time. so to avoid the
	  embarrassment of subjecting them to my tedious and winding
	  rambles, i defer revealing anything about myself to some
	  other day, some other person, some other time. this happens
	  all the time.

	  <p>it wasn't always like this. i knew someone who looked at
	  me with so much kindness and care that no matter how long it
	  took me to get to the point, they would listen with the just
	  the same amount of curiosity as if i had just begun
	  talking. absorbing everything into the marrow of their
	  being. and with the weight of everything i have said to
	  them, would somehow unfailingly find a softer and kinder way
	  of looking at it all.

	  <p>what do you imagine is the sensible thing to do when one
	  finds someone like this? Hold onto them for dear life?
	  Protect and cherish them? Find a way to reciprocate that is
	  just as endearing and beautiful as them?

    <p>you'll find me in the bed that i made years ago, struggling to
    find words for what i've felt and done. grapes of wrath, flowers
    of evil, an unforgiving chimera tearing everything to pieces. </p>
      <p>i'm sorry. for all the havoc and pain.</p>
      <p>i was sick. am sick. but convalescing now, amid the detritus of a life that once had more order, meaning and love...and now with the lingering memories of someone who is now somewhere else - in a boat, rowing conscientously, towards a better place hopefully.</p>

      <p>here's a song that reminds me of them, and their capacity to feel and express love.</p>
      <audio controls>
   <source src="la_vie_en_rose_3xvol.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
   the song is "la vie en rose", first sung by Edith Piaf in 1935.
      </audio>

      <p>other times, I find myself walking in little parks late at night, singing the following song to myself...

	a melody to commemorate sorrow, felt on observing all the wounds inflicted by a creature lashing out in pain:</p>

      <p>this song is called "komm susser tod" (come sweet death), and is sung by Julia Chahayed who i found here on the web. thanks for visiting.  in time there might be more here. i'm not
      sure. till then, you're invited to visit what younger me was
	like <a href="https://pulkit12083.github.io"> in 2022</a>. </p>
