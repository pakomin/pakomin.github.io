    <p>you'll find me walking outdoors late at night, asking
      questions to unravel the mystery that is my past. The vast
      majority of which lies behind the events of 2023.

      <p>Since then I've been building all my intuitions about the world
      and myself anew. As if I've been reborn and now need to figure
      out the world all over again. Health insurance, purchasing a new
      car, finding a different job, doing the bare minimum at the one
      i have, or even putting words to what i think. It all feels
      overwhelmingly complex. When I look around myself for help, I
      find people in my friends and family have some approximate
      intuitions, guiding principles, and a mental map on how to
      navigate these terrains. Techniques, methods, ideas on how to
      overcome challenges. I seem to have lost all of mine. So I rely
      heavily on others for the time being. Taking lots of help, and
      trying to assimilate all their cognitions into mine to get a
      better grip on how to do things. But when it comes to finally
      making a decision and doing something, I end up getting
      stuck. Unable to tell the true value of things, I end up not
      knowing which way to go. So I postpone the decision to a later
      date. And meanwhile, do what comes most easily to me - rest.

      <p>I know that I can't do this forever. Eventually I will need to
      leave this coccoon of inactivity in which i have wrapped
      myself. But I still need time in this place. Everything outside
      it seems confusing and meaningless to me until I've figured out
      the answer to some questions that plague my mind. Each of them
      posed by the painful memories of a depressing time made worse by
      decisions that i now no longer understand. "Why the hell did i
      do that?" I think to myself on one of these late night walks,
      but cannot figure it out. It would help if i had a better memory
      of my thoughts and feelings from before - so that I could piece
      together who i was in order to give myself a satisfactory
      answer. But I am extraordinarily forgetful - especially so of
      everything preceding 2023. I could refer to what I've written in
      my journals, or go back to the messages from before. But doing
      so engulfs me in the pain of regret at not having acted
      differently. It shows me the painful "what"'s but not the
      desired "why"'s. Its the latter I want. if I know why it all
      turned out the way it did, I might then know what to do
      differently and then correspondingly avoid ending up in the same
      place as 2023 again. Then I might know what to tell everyone
      about why I was gone. Then I might feel sure of myself in
      returning to everyday life, with an answer for everything that
      happened.
      

<p> I know all this is oblique. I'm dancing around the raw facts of
      what happened - sordid as they are. I'd rather you have them
      with the knowledge of what preceeded them - both in real life in
      my head, with all the context that any painful travesty
      deserves. So I walk - in my head and out in the dark night - in
      circles mostly to slowly come around to that context, piecing it
      together so that i can one day give it to everyone here who
      hears about all the unconscionable things i have said and done.

    <p> i've thought a lot about how to structure this site. in what order should i present everything to you? most pages on the internet present things in the "latest comes first" way. That's the default. Even here. But there's an issue with this. You'll read this page from top to down. this means you will encounter what i have to say to you in the reverse order of time. But that is not how i've lived at all. Seemingly innocuous discrepancy, but utterly vexing for someone who wants to tell you his story in real time.


    <p>Also, this isn't exactly in reverse order. This section is written in chronological order. I'm writing this as time is moving forward and you are reading this as time is moving forward. But eventually this section will end. There will be a horizontal line. And then you will jump further <i>backwards</i> in time and then read that section chronologically too. So it's half-reverse-half-forward.

      Unlike a novel. In which everything flows forward. Simple and straightforward as any story should be.

    <p> i would not mind depresion nearly as much, if at the very
    least it would not deprive me of the goddamned words with which to
    describe it. bottomless grief, felt over and over. to what end?
    what do i do with this?

      <p>these days i'm in the goldilocks zone of sadness.

      <p>it's the zone of being when the sadness isn't so overwhelming
      that it leaves me at an utter loss of words, but also hasn't
      waned to the point that speaking about it is complicated by
      other feelings and realizations.

      if i look into it for long enough, i find myself submerged,
      deluged, engulfed all over again. and then there's nothing to do
      but wait, and go for a walk somewhere to bear it.

      sometimes i get to look at it from some distance (but not too
      much) that allows me to tell you a little about it. that's the
      place from where i'm writing. it's not ideal however. it's easy,
      in this place, to inadvertently mischaracterize what it was like
	to be deluged.

	i also am wary of speaking to you like a typical "writer". i
	am writing this on my laptop yes, but i'm not "writing" (as in
	the activity in which one sits down with the explicit purpose
	of composing a text to look at and admire and feel good about
	oneself and one's achievement). I sure as fuck don't intend to
	do the latter. If I'm putting anything up here on this blog,
	it is only to just tell you things.

    <p>you'll find me walking outdoors, sometime around 2AM, looking
    at trees catching a breeze or two. it's quieter, and nicer. there
    is a gentleness to things. there's more stillness. it seems like a
    place that imparts adequate dignity to the presence of someone
    carrying a painful memory. sometimes, when the breeze is just
    right, and when i've lost track of time, lost track of nights
    spent circling the same sadnesses, i'm able to bring myself to
    endure the that memory just enough to see it in a way that's more
    forgiving, and less painful.


      <p>i've been hiding so far. from everyone. from the entire world
      actually. because i do not know how to justify myself in my own
      eyes.  every time i think of appearing in front of the world, i
      imagine that appearance being seen by her, who knows about me
      what the rest of the world doesn't. having seen an excresence of
      my spirit that was harmful and poisonous.

	eager to extend compassion and
      kindness, you might think that i'm being too hard on myself. but
      there is a realm of humanity which is considered undeserving,
      maybe rightfully so, of any understanding. when i'm out on a
      walk late at night, it is to find understanding for something in
      that realm.


      <p>i talk in indirect ways. not stating anything clearly. it's
      only because i'm yet to figure out how to speak clearly and
      directly without immediately losing any compassion or
      understanding of myself. what good is it to speak without those
      two qualites. without which, i will only end up doing what i've
      done my entire life. curse myself. be pained, frustrated,
      and angry at myself. even hateful. i don't want that to be your
      reward for having given me your time and attention. i'd rather
      just talk in circles until i've figured out how to explain
      everything. so there. i'll be talking in circles. not forever i
      hope. just until i know how to speak about the unspeakable.

	<p>when i'm by myself, i'm just me. beset with myriad
	sadnesses. but still in the company of someone who can give
	  himself all the time in the world to come around to his life.

	  but when i am in the company of anyone else, i feel
	  intensely responsible for their time. so to avoid the
	  embarrassment of subjecting them to my tedious and winding
	  rambles, i defer revealing anything about myself to some
	  other day, some other person, some other time. this happens
	  all the time.

	  <p>it wasn't always like this. i knew someone who looked at
	  me with so much kindness and care that no matter how long it
	  took me to get to the point, they would listen with the just
	  the same amount of curiosity as if i had just begun
	  talking. absorbing everything into the marrow of their
	  being. and with the weight of everything i have said to
	  them, would somehow unfailingly find a softer and kinder way
	  of looking at it all.

	  <p>what do you imagine is the sensible thing to do when one
	  finds someone like this? Hold onto them for dear life?
	  Protect and cherish them? Find a way to reciprocate that is
	  just as endearing and beautiful as them?

    <p>you'll find me in the bed that i made years ago, struggling to
    find words for what i've felt and done. grapes of wrath, flowers
    of evil, an unforgiving chimera tearing everything to pieces. </p>
      <p>i'm sorry. for all the havoc and pain.</p>
      <p>i was sick. am sick. but convalescing now, amid the detritus of a life that once had more order, meaning and love...and now with the lingering memories of someone who is now somewhere else - in a boat, rowing conscientously, towards a better place hopefully.</p>

      <p>here's a song that reminds me of them, and their capacity to feel and express love.</p>
      <audio controls>
   <source src="la_vie_en_rose_3xvol.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
   the song is "la vie en rose", first sung by Edith Piaf in 1935.
      </audio>

      <p>other times, I find myself walking in little parks late at night, singing the following song to myself...

	a melody to commemorate sorrow, felt on observing all the wounds inflicted by a creature lashing out in pain:</p>

   the song is komm susser tod: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuQzHGcsjlA

      <p>this song is called "komm susser tod" (come sweet death), and is sung by Julia Chahayed who i found here on the web. thanks for visiting.  in time there might be more here. i'm not
      sure. till then, you're invited to visit what younger me was
	like <a href="https://pulkit12083.github.io"> in 2022</a>. </p>
