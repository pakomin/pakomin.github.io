      <p>you'll find me in the bed that i made years ago, struggling to find words for what i've felt and done. grapes of wrath, flowers of evil, an unforgiving chimera tearing everything to pieces </p>
      <p>i'm sorry. for all the havoc and pain.</p>
      <p>i was sick. am sick. but convalescing now, amid the detritus of a life that once had more order, meaning and love...and now with the lingering memories of someone who is now somewhere else. in a boat, rowing conscientously towards a better place hopefully.</p>

      <p>here's a song that reminds me of them, and their capacity to feel and express love</p>

	a melody to commemorate sorrow, felt on observing all the wounds inflicted by a creature lashing out in pain:</p>
