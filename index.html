have you heard about depression?
<br>
it's a sickness where you feel sad beyond measure, and guilty too.
<br>
i discovered, and then felt, what happens when it becomes a bit too intense.
<br>
Enter O.C.D, and psychosis. I often find myself trying to think of the
right combination of words, to express what it's been like with
these two fiends, my companions since 2023.
<br>
It's quite the challenge. 
<br>
I'm convalescing now, amid the detritus of a life that once had more
order, meaning, and love..
<br>
.. and someone who is no longer here.
<br>
here's a song that reminds me of them:

<br>
other times, I find myself singing the following song to myself..
<br>
..a melody to commemmorate the wounds inflicted by a pained creature
lashing out..
